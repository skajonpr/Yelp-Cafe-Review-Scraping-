Bird & Branch,5.0,"This is a well deserved 5 stars. Everything from quality, service, uniqueness, and ambiance!! And that's coming from a coffee snob who's been trying a couple new coffee spots each weekend.  I got the blackbird which included thyme and blackberries in a cappuccino-like form. 10/10. My husband got the coffee flight, and the employees even brought the flight over to where we were sitting, explained each bean within each flight of espresso. Huge fan of the Burundi espresso bean, it had floral/fruity undertone like nothing we had ever tried before! Would come back and by just the beans too.  AND their food was sooo fresh and yummy. The nori avocado toast was delicious, it's topped with sesame to give an extra boost of flavor.  Honestly, I was a die hard Blue Bottle coffee drinker as it's two blocks from where I live, but I think this place is now right up there (plus they offer more unique coffees if you're looking to spice up your weekend coffee!).  Price was comparable to other coffee shops. But if I had to choose between a $6 coffee at Starbucks or Bird & Branch, hands down it would be bird and branch!!",5.0,3/2/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,I love the concept and how unique everything was. The avocado toast looked amazing but I had just had breakfast and wish I hadn't! I had the coffee sampler and the rotation today was not pleasant.  The espresso shot was so sour and too floral to be enjoyable.  The cortado was okay and easier to enjoy.  The ice coffee was pleasant. We added some sugar to help with the acidic after taste.  I would like to go back to try the macadamia nut latte which seemed to be the most popular item.,3.0,3/2/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"A small, perfect coffee and pastry place in Hell's Kitchen that stands head-and-shoulders above the myriad mediocre midtown mud joints.  Start with passionate people behind the bar, top of the line everything from the beans to the equipment, including some exquisite matcha, and add a small, but intensely good selection of pastries. If you don't make your way over here, and sample passion and perfection, then what the heck ""I live in a $20m and have a $600k parking space"" kind of New Yorker are you?  Authenticity and quality rock this cozy place a stone's throw from Broadway and Times Square. Be there!",5.0,2/12/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Nice coffee shop, good for working or for a break from work. Matcha latte looks really cool but taste average... Wouldn't go out of the way to try it.",3.0,3/17/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Great new cute coffee shop with really good coffee in Hell's Kitchen. Can't wait to come back! Few coffee shops this nice in the area.  Saint Frank coffee roasters (San Francisco), currently they're using the Guatemala single origin for espresso drinks. Nice to find a different toaster because NY is dominated usually by the same coffee beans.  Staff are nice. Space is very cute and attention to detail for the decor.  Also tried the matcha square desert. Very good, strong matcha flavor and moist and gooey.",5.0,12/30/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"This is such a cute cafe! I'm visiting New York from Southern California, and I passed by this cafe multiple times but didn't really go in until today (the day I'm supposed to leave lol). The baristas were super friendly and nice. I got the earl grey tea and nori avocado toast. I was surprised by how good the avocado toast was! I also bought a shirt and reusable cup because they were so cute. I also really appreciated the small efforts they made to be more environmentally friendly, like using metal straws for drinks and having separate compartments for trash, compost, plastic, and etc. Wish I can come back if I'm ever in New York again!",5.0,3/10/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Service 5/5 Toast 4/5 Drink 2/5 My blackbird latte, with espresso, blackberries, thyme and housemade macadamia milk wasn't the best combination, as the blackberries were to sweet/tart to go with the acidity of the espresso, however I could tell by drinking it that the espresso aspect on its own would probably be bomb. This is the kind of creative spirit I live for when it comes to food! I had a toast with yuzu jam and ricotta cheese, which was a first for me, and it was great, the bread was quality, soft, with crispy flavorful edges! They also have hooks for your coat, which is so sweet! I'll have to come back some time and try some more of the more unique creations on the menu, who knows, maybe one of the crazy concoctions will be my cryptonite!",4.0,1/16/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Honeslty a really good place to sit down and just work. Idk why the other reviews say not to but the wifi here is free, seating was readily available (granted i came here on a rainy day) and there were plenty of outlets. I got a regular iced coffee and it came in a nice cute cup with a metal straw which is a huge plus to me. Great place to sit relax and have a relatively quiet place to work. Gotta try their other stuff an",5.0,3/21/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"I can't believe a quality neighborhood cafe as good as this exists just blocks away from the Times Square/Port Authority madness! What a fantastic spot for delicious drinks and lighter fare.  Their signature drinks are really cool, with lots of interesting ingredients for a little variety from the norm. I tried the blackbird, which has to be one of the most unusual and delicious lattes I've had. I believe blackberries made their way into the mix (the ingredients are listed in the store), giving it a fruity, tart flavor under the creamy latte texture. Really good stuff!  I also had a cappuccino, which was delicious; very smooth without any bitterness. It seems like the cafe prides itself on its coffee, going so far as to offer flights so you can taste all the different beans being used. The staff (owners?) who helped me out were incredibly kind and happy to talk about their products in a helpful way.  Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for an excellent coffee shop that caters to locals!",5.0,12/21/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,Tried this place out on Sunday while I was in nyc and was really impressed! The shop is pretty small so you may not necessarily find a spot to sit but you should get their coffee and pastries to go! I got the americano and also the chia yogurt. The americano was strong and hit the spot! And the chia yogurt was really good! I wanted to take some for the road. We also tried the kouign-Amann which was delicious! It was sweet and flaky. The service was also great! The server gave good tips on the pastries and also was pleasant and hospitable. 5/5 would definitely go back.,5.0,2/19/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"There are so many nice restaurant around Hell's Kitchen , but I always feel not enough nice and stylish cafe around there. But finally I meet here this new cafe in my hood! I usually use the to-go Mexican right next door and found cute sign and interior that really stand out in this block however they didn't open yet. And I was so excited about  opening!  I was so happy to have this opportunity to have this coffee tasting event! I'm actually not really coffee person, but I always curious about the taste of coffee since they have so many type of beans and roast...and origin..  Here, this cafe is best learning coffee and beans. The owner and stuff are really kind and knowledgeable coffee and some other beverage. They deal the coffee beans from San Francisco and also have most excellent n famous matcha  brand ""ippodo"" in Japan  I trusted their taste and selection very well.  Additional  remarkable  point is sweets! I can't stop eating their sesame browny and matcha as well. I'm usually not so interested in Peanuts butter, but their cookies were an exception!  Home made almond macadamia milk latte also great ! If weather is nice, sit outside table on the street side!",4.0,11/8/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"I've been craving avocado toast lately and am so glad I found this place! It's very small and cozy, and put me in such a good mood after braving (walking) through the cold.  I actually didn't get to try their Nori Avocado toast because they didn't have avocados when I came in, but the Miso Hummus was so good! I usually don't eat tomatoes (hate it), but it went so well with the miso hummus that I left no tomatoes behind. The thick toast was topped with miso hummus (very flavorful), tomatoes, and olive oil. It's perfect-- I wouldn't change a thing!  I also ordered the Yuzu Ricotta toast, which was very light in flavor. The yuzu topping was slightly sweet, and I think I could've used more yuzu on my toast, but overall this wasn't bad. If I had to pick just one toast, I would go with the Miso Hummus.  I love all things matcha and black sesame so of course I ordered both brownies! The matcha and black sesame brownies were denser than a regular brownie, but I really enjoyed the flavor!",5.0,11/23/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Coffee shops in NYC are a dime a dozen. Every few blocks you find one, and I don't even mean Starbucks which I avoid unless in need of the loo. A long time Hell's Kitchen'er, I've been eating at El Rancho (yelp.com/biz/el-rancho-b…) for years, formerly La Paloma Burritos before they had a fire and remodeled. In my humble opinion they've got the best cheap burritos in town. Plus they are a BYOB establishment, as long as you're 21 of course.  I'm a bit late in the game here, but the other day I visited Bird & Branch with my mom to have some java. It was her recommendation as she said she loves the place. It opened in Feb 2018 and I just haven't made my way over till now, although I've walked by it several times. It's a cute, clean, friendly little cafe and I see why she likes it. I had one of their special season features called 'The Wren'. It was absolutely delicious. My mom's Almond Macadamia Milk Latte was spot on too. Our barista Alex was really nice and told us that the place is the child of Faith and Brandon, a married couple that I think live in Hell's Kitchen.  There's a few tables to sit at and they have wifi, but it ain't Starbucks so don't plop yourself down to stay and surf the net all day nursing one Cup of Joe. They don't have a public restroom, but there's one right next door at El Rancho that they'll probably let you use.  In the summer Bird & Branch has a nice long wooden bench set up outside to sit at. I'll sure I'll be doing some coffee lounging there come summertime. Definitely worth checking this place out if you haven't already.",4.0,1/28/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"I almost don't want to review Bird & Branch for purely selfish reasons like keeping this hidden gem to myself, but I'm trying to be a better person in 2019, so here we go. Reasons why it's my go-to westside reco:  - Convenient location for locals and tourists alike (more about this below) - Beautiful and unique crafted drinks that don't forgo quality - Plenty of seating (at least 10 high and low barstools with two window benches which seat 2-3 each), lots of green plants, high ceiling, natural lighting, low jazz comfort music in the background  Location-wise I've found Bird & Branch to attract a hybrid of both locals and tourists. It's just far enough from all of the Broadway theaters to offer a quiet break and regrouping away from the insanity that is Times Square and yet The Spot Next Door for locals. As a local myself, I'm not sure how this balance was struck, but it works.  Seating: The little bar stool seats are perfect for families, especially those with kids. I've seen folks from out of town wheel their suitcases in and park them under the high bar stool area. There's even room for small to medium sized groups (book clubs, youth groups, etc.) around 3-5 ppl during off-peak hours. You can tell the owners of this shop were very intentional and thoughtful of creating an inclusive space for The People.  Drinks: 1. I love love love love love LOVE the Robin. Can I say that again? I love the Robin. It's got no caffeine (say what?!) BUT the soothingness and the rich balance of turmeric, ginger, cayenne, and milk bring to my throat is unbelievable - especially during a long fought battle with a never-ending cough or mid-winter ""I just want to feel warmth again"" feels. Get this if your throat wants to be hugged by a blanket of love. 2. Seasonals: The Parakeet. Tried, tasted, was surprised, did not love, finished.. and still unsure whether I enjoyed it or felt obligated to drink cause I paid money. It's a unique drink for sure - pineapple (most prominent taste) + mulled cider + spices. Nice on the throat, but if you're going for that, you may as well stick with the Robin. 3. Also a seasonal drink: The Wren. If you like peanut butter, this is you! Be forewarned though - this drink has salt, not sugar. It's not your Reese's Pieces. And the serving size is on the smaller side.  Final words: As with all places, there are some downsides ya'll should know about: - Not a cheap coffee stop, but hey, it's Manhattan - No bathroom for customers. Kind of stinks, but they've got to make money too! Can't have people hanging around all day.",5.0,1/20/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"While waiting for a table for brunch, we decided to kill some time here at this relatively new cafe. We ordered a cappuccino with low fat milk and a flat white with almond milk. The cappuccino was very smooth but the flat white was a little sour, not sure if it was because of the almond milk but it felt a bit off. There are a few tables, probably able to fit maximum 10 people, which is relatively normal for an NYC cafe. Very clean set up and friendly staff!",4.0,1/20/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"This is my home away from home!  A lot of thought behind the aesthetics (owner-made moss wall!) and the menu. The owners care deeply about coffee, and it's reflected in their consistently good drip coffee, rotated on a weekly basis. However, I adore their specialty drinks, so the challenge is deciding what to have on any given day.  Based on my extensive research to date, things to drink:  Robin: My go-to, an amazing blend of gingery goodness and spices. They use fresh turmeric root, not the powder. It's their version of a chai latte, with deeper flavors. It's delicious hot or iced, and is made with their housemade almond macadamia nut milk (dairy free!).  Sparrow: espresso with house lemon soda and seltzer. This sounded so weird that I didn't get it until like 6 months after. It's possibly the most refreshing and delicious espresso drink you could get for a hot summer day. I highly recommend trying it at least once!  Matcha Latte: I usually order a matcha latte at coffeeshops over coffee, so I've had a decent sampling of them all over NY and at coffee shops when I'm visiting other cities. Hands down, this is the best matcha latte I've ever had. It's got depth of matcha flavor, and the drink itself is so creamy it almost feels decadent. I usually have mine with almond macadamia milk, which adds a creamy nuttiness to the flavor as well.  They use ceremonial grade matcha from Ippodo, and sift the matcha powder. I overheard another customer one morning say that his wife now refuses to order a matcha latte from anywhere else, because the one from Bird & Branch does not have that matcha powder sludge at the bottom of the cup. I completely agree and also find myself unable to enjoy matcha lattes from other places as much. They are usually too watery, and added to menus as an afterthought.  - Mockingbird. This was a seasonal drink where they used kabocha squash, which is a Japanese pumpkin, to create their version of a pumpkin spice latte. It was bomb. I miss it every day.  - Nightingale - Earl grey infused espresso drink! This is really good, Early grey come out strong even though it tends to be a subtle flavor  To eat: -  Kouign amanns: if you've never had one, show yourself a little love and get one - any of their squares: they have matcha, black sesame, and spicy brownie - peanut butter cookie: I find these irresistible. Seriously. The most peanut buttery cookie I've had, dense and moist, chunks of chocolate, hint of salt. So good. - Toasts: the miso hummus and yuzu ricotta toasts are my favorite. Avocado toast is quite good too (it includes seaweed, which adds a kick of umami) - Earl grey shortbread: small shortbread cookie that's perfect for a quick treat  It's fun to see new items pop up on the menu. The owners dream up new ideas, and then work to perfect them before rolling them out. I love being a regular-- the space here peaceful and soothing, an oasis in the heart of Times Square/Hell's Kitchen.",5.0,1/17/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"I ventured to try the black bird. The combination of blackberry and coffee was tempting. The result was ok I guess. I don't like sour coffee anyways, and of course with some black berry syrup the coffee turned quite tart. I was still happy with my drink. It was just not quite my thing. Hubby's mocha was very good. Not too sweet. It's a cute little shop with only around 10 seats. Be prepared to have to take your coffee to go on weekend afternoon.",4.0,3/5/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"I've been here a couple of times, and I do not see the hype. Sure, the place is cute, but it's not practical, as there are few seats. And the coffee is good, but it's not going to blow your mind, as the prices would suggest. $3.50 for coffee... $6 lattes... $6 puddings. It's a bit much. My friend and I spent $17 on a snack, a plain latte, and a black coffee. That's almost two salads.  Almond macadamia nut latte - big portion, but it tastes like a regular old latte.  Black coffee with almond milk - $3.50 for a small cup renders it too much to make it your regular coffee place. It's good coffee, but it doesn't taste that much better than what local cafes offer in the vicinity.  Chia seed pudding - it's not bad. Makes for a good snack. Tastes better when you mix up the red syrup into the chia seeds. But as someone who buys chia seeds and berries regularly, I know it's really overpriced!  I'd come back to try their other lattes if someone were to treat me! Otherwise, it's an A-OK cafe with a sweet couple who owns and runs the place, and I'm glad I've tried it; I'd recommend it if you are looking to splurge on coffee.",3.0,8/27/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Never heard of Bird & Branch so when I passed by, I felt compelled to check it out.  This immaculate little cafe serves nibbles and beverages. I was browsing the menu when the barista had given a sample of the Starling iced tea (sencha tea that is cold brewed and carbonated) to a customer.  He had done so because it had quite the unusual flavor. Not all taste buds will go for it.  He also offered me a try and of course, could not refuse. I instantly liked it whereupon the other customer passed and ordered something more traditional. Fear not, they serve  familiar foods and beverages.  I went ahead and ordered the Starling. Two sizes---$5.50 for 16 oz or $6.00 for 20 oz. Yes, kind of steep. I thought it was very good especially since it was slightly carbonated. Also for sample were their spicy brownies which were very good.  I only ordered a beverage but they serve baked goods and sandwiches, coffee and tea. Also available was a refrigerated section containing other bottled beverages and chia puddings, etc.  Cute.",4.0,8/10/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Bird & Branch is one of my new favorite spots in the city!!  I came here for a Yelp event, where I was able to try a variety of their desserts and their single origin coffees. Everything was absolutely wonderful! I particularly loved their Columbian coffee. As far as their desserts go, everything was delicious. My favorites were definitely the black sesame square (I'm admittedly biased; black sesame is my favorite dessert flavor by far!), their spicy chocolate brownie (actually spicy!), and the peanut butter chocolate cookie. I'd definitely order any one of these (or all, if we are being realistic and you promise not to judge) next time I come back here. The matcha square and ginger molasses cookie were also great.  I loved everything so much that I stayed after the event and ordered some more things from the menu! They make their own almond macadamia nut milk and it's to die for. I had their almond macadamia milk latte. I normally am a black coffee drinker and don't really ""do"" lattes, but this was one of the best things I've ever tried. Not too sweet at all. If this is your first time here, I highly recommend this drink!  Outside of having phenomenal coffee and desserts, the staff really stands out. Everyone is very knowledgable and passionate about what they do. The atmosphere is very small and cozy and incredibly popular in the neighborhood.  It's a must try. I'll come back whenever I'm in the area for sure, and would even travel out of my way just to come here.",5.0,8/15/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"My kind of coffee place. Cute, cozy, friendly service, and yummy coffee. It was my first time here. After walking by it and reading so many great reviews about it, I had to stop by. I love supporting the non chain coffee spots. The iced macadamia milk latte was creamy and delicious. I also loved that they use metal straws. They have unique lattes and delicious food items. It makes me want to try everything on the menu. Will definitely be returning and taking my mom here as well when she visits. I don't think they had a bathroom though. Apart from that, the decor and ambiance were really great. It's an awesome spot for reading, working, socializing, or even for a first date! I already know what I'm going to order next time.",5.0,6/26/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,Amazing cashew milk lattes and avocado toast. I also bought a bag of coffee to bring home and was very happy with the taste and quality. The owners of the cafe are so kind and engaging. Definitely the best coffee shop in NYC!,3.0,3/6/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Trendy coffee shop with quaint interior tables and a little oasis on the street outside, a seating area to sip and people watch. Friendly staff and quality items for order. I got sucked into a name, the DIRTY PIGEON. I mean, when in Rome....It is an egg cream with espresso and it's intense. My partner enjoyed her almond macadamia milk latte immensely. The earl grey shortbread cookies were the best I've ever had! Some toasts and croissants are other light fare food offerings. Located in the theater district, so if you have some time to kill before a show this is a perfect place to do it.",5.0,8/27/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"I stumbled upon this place one evening while a friend and I were looking to kill 30 minutes before going to see a show. The theater district is not the most relaxing area to hang out given the large number of tourists and all of the hustle and bustle, so we walked west and ran into Bird & Branch. It's close enough to the theaters to grab a quick coffee/tea/latte before a show, but feels sufficiently out-of-the-way enough to allow for a nice and quite chat with a friend. I ordered ""the robin"" which is essentially a tumeric and ginger latte. It was smooth, not too sweet, and had a nice spicy kick to it. The tumeric really adds to the uniqueness of the drink, and the color of course! My friend had the hot chocolate which was also quite nice. I really like this place. The drinks are unique and delicious, the staff is super friendly, and the space is really cute!",3.0,12/3/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769

Bird & Branch,5.0,"I try not to spend too much money on drinks, but wow I just dropped $7 on a latte here and I'm not even mad.  I've been to Bird & Branch a couple of times now. It's a 5 min walk from my office so I take ALL my walking meetings here. Now some coworkers love coming here too (spreading the word one meeting at a time)! It's such a sanctuary in this hellhole of time square/midtown (gotta say it like it is). I also sometimes go to the dance studio across the street so this cafe is just super convenient for all purposes. The interior is nicely decorated with enough space for probably ~10 people and they have wifi in case you want to work. The owners/workers are all super nice and pleasant.  I've head the matcha latte, matcha affagato, the sparrow, and the blackbird so far. The matcha affagato rivals the one you can get at Bluesone and the Blackbird is my favorite non matcha drink so far. I don't drink too much coffee but it gives me a nice kick and it's not too bitter. Prices are the expected $5-7 for coffee drinks in NYC (insert cry empty wallet emoji) and a little less for tea. They also have some pastries which I haven't tried before. I did sample their chocolate brownie once and didn't know it was spicy lol.  Overall, great vibes. The best cafe I've found in this area. I wish they had a stamp card/loyalty program though ;)",5.0,7/18/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,Literally stumbled upon this quaint coffee shop on a Saturday morning. We got there around 9am and they weren't busy but the crowd started coming in.  I think what really makes these place is the vibe and minimalistic decorations. It is such a cool coffee shop feel with nice owners.  I had the almond macadamia milk lattè iced. They make the milk in house which is neat. It was $5.75 but so worth it!  Not a lot of seating inside so plan ahead if you're having a coffee date. The pastry options looked really good but didn't try any. Will definitely try it again!,4.0,7/21/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"This is such a CUTE little shop! I ordered a mocha and it was seriously the best I've had in my life! Not bitter, super smooth, not too sweet & they put real vanilla bean in the latte which was a super nice touch. Their pastries also look out of this world! I didn't get one, but I definitely will be on my next stop in...which will be soon! They also have cute merch on sale and you can buy their beans!

Bird & Branch,5.0,I found the coffee flight quite acidic for my taste. The place has just enough sitting. More of a grab and go place but has enough outlets and chairs in case you want to stay for a bit. It's not that spacious and they don't have a restroom (they're not required to since they are a small place). The guy barista earlier was very entertaining and helpful with his suggestions. It's a cute place to visit and I might even come back to taste their lattes.,4.0,2/2/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Had a delicious whole wheat croissant here.  Not too buttery, it had a good crunch on the outside and chewiness on the inside.  The almond macademia latte was ok, I would've preferred just straight almond milk as this one was a bit tart.  Cute interior.",5.0,11/15/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"This place just opened ~6 weeks ago and I decided to give it a try given how the photos on Yelp looked.  I'm always a fan of trying to find good matcha near my office.  Bird & Branch didn't disappoint - the owner was very helpful and explained anything we had questions on. When we asked if we could try the house made almond macadamia milk, he was eager to give us a small shot to try before we buy. The milk is so nice and creamy, sweetened with dates rather than sugar!  We ordered matcha lattes with the sesame brownie. The lattes are a good balance of milk and matcha and very smooth.  Definitely try the black sesame brownie! It tastes like the filling in sesame tang yuan (glutinous rice balls). Very nice and strong sesame flavor, but also not too sweet. It's also very moist!",4.0,4/15/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769

Bird & Branch,5.0,"The housemade almond macadamia milk latte is amazing (I enjoyed it hot). Their almond macadamia milk is out of this world! It is thick, creamy and you won't miss dairy one bit. They also have a variety of other espresso drinks and coffee. No cold brew here.  They have a selection of pastries and some are baked in house I believe!  Love the concept and decor of the store. It is like a small and serene getaway from the busy streets of Hell's Kitchen. Lots of natural sunlight in the day time, and cozy seats. Not a ton of seating- maybe seats 10-12?  Owners are great and really friendly. I will definitely return for a solid cup of coffee/ espresso in Hell's Kitchen.",4.0,9/14/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"This new kid in the block is definitely a place to watch out for. The owners are the most amazing and humble people who truly care for things and make sure to bring out the best coffee from across the globe to you. This place is heaven especially for people who love black coffees. I didn't know there can be so much to know about my coffee that i mindlessly drink every morning until they described it in details. Just like wine tasting, you should come try their coffee flights and let magic beans cast the spell on you. The decor is very modern and neat. Big space with seats around for you to sit. Their bakes goods are amazing. I got the pleasure to try the matcha cakes, sesame cake, chocolate with spice in it! yess you read that right. This was so unique, as the chocolate melts in your mouth, the spice will kick right in. My fav was matcha cake. Don't miss it. And don't miss this place. Thanks to the yelp team and Rafi, otherwise i would have taken ages to discover this  gem.",5.0,8/13/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Got off the bus at Port Authority & needed a coffee or something matcha badly. Found this new & pretty cafe on Yelp & decided to check it out, as their menu looked interesting.  1st impression, the place is unassuming & just off the Avenue of Hell's Kitchen, on a quite tree-lined block. Their BEAUTIFUL parking spot public seating ""installation"" is a work of art. I sense a West Coast influence? A former architect/artist? Their space is sunny & spacious, with a small high top counter & 2 small seating areas at both windows. Great Design- everything's pale pink & white with clean angles & pops of greenery. Their octagon white tile coffee table looks homemade, fitting the short danish?-style stools perfectly. Their small retail section is interesting to look at & shows a #zerowaste mindset. The garbage sorting/sugar/untensil area is Amazing. Can you come to my house & make me one please?  The owners seemed to put in a lot of care and hard work into the business. The menu also reflects that, with a tumeric latte, good coffee, fig & cheese danish, earl grey & black sesame shortbread cookies, and strawberry & pistachio kouign amman, chia cups, to name a few. (They are displayed in clear glass boxes that you'd probably find at the Anthropology jewelry section.) The staff was very nice & patient. They seemed to already have regulars, with cute dogs.  However, my lower review is about the product. I appreciate the quality in The matcha brownie ($3) was dense. But it was *too* intense, I guess that's why they have small bags of brownie ""ends"" for sale, scared to eat that whole brownie! It tastes more like a blondie with matcha notes at the end. Left mouth feeling dry/tart in the way good matcha does. The Blackbird latte ($6) was tasty at first impression, coffee was strong & nutty, you can taste hints of blackberry & a hint of herbal, (not sure about the sprinkles of dried thyme on top though) a few crushed seeds at the bottom of the cup. But the homemade almond macadamia nut milk they use (like heavy cream) was *too* heavy after a few sips & a bit nauseating. The initial coffee & sweetness seemed to disappear & I was mostly tasting creamy stuff. Later on when the ice melted, it was easier to drink, but by then it tasted like a regular latte.  The pricing is higher that what I would normally pay for similar items (well- never had a matcha brownie before!), & I'm sure to to cover all the extra work for quality ingredients (squeezing all those nuts!) and manhattan location. I would only visit Branch & Bird as a special treat & very rarely. I hope they do well though, really great ideas & attention detail, nice staff. But only a rare return visit from me. Too bad.",4.0,10/15/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769

Bird & Branch,5.0,"Came here for a yelp event & you can just tell this place is surrounded by good! The owners are humble & selfless and you can tell they run their business in an ethical way. Everything they serve is high quality here. They don't blend their beans here and keep the coffee true to the source. These people really know coffee and aim to deliver the highest quality experience and coffee to their customers!  I was able to try a variety of their desserts and I was blown away! My favorites were probably the matcha and sesame cakes. They were both so moist and flavorful...I'm not usually a huge fan of dessert, but these two items surprised me! Absolutely delicious. I have no complaints--the product is high quality and the owners are wonderful as well. Come here to support an ethical, local business that also just happens to serve amaaazing coffee and snacks.",4.0,8/13/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"Guys! This is a public service announcement. I am in love with this coffee shop. We were visiting NYC and didn't want to just roll into in any coffee shop - we needed to be happily caffeinated to start day and this place is it! And the location is perfect since it was not too far from our hotel and not too deep into Times Square. The workers are so sweet. Coffee is delicious, pastries bomb.com  and place is so chic and clean. Weezer was playing in the background. Mix of tourists and locals- just loved the vibe.",5.0,2/5/2019,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"If I could sum-up my experience with this Coffee Establishment in one word it would be : ""Breathtaking""  Like the majority of people in NY coffee and tea are one of the most important parts of our lives. I'm sure that we've all gone to numerous coffee shops and have our go to spot for our personal reasons. For me, I've explored a great amount of cafes all around the city and neighboring boroughs from, Grounded (Lower West), The infamous Blue Bottle, Rex, Toby's Estate, etc.  When it comes to rating my favorite coffee establishment, I have three criteria that I always take in account for: Atmosphere, People, and Coffee (of course).  Granted most coffee drinkers only care about the taste of the coffee as that is the purpose of going to that establishment in the first place. BUT, when it comes to coffee culture, its a combination of all three. For any product, we always want to have a good experience going into an establishment; whether that's from an amazing conversation with the barista, a feel good environment to relax and work in, or the jaw dropping taste of their product.  I don't want to sound cliche, but Bird and Branch is the only place that manages to accomplish all those three criteria's.  Atmosphere Walking towards the establishment, you're greeting with this vibrant and inviting sign of Bird & Branch. Outside of the establishment, they were able to set up an endearing, modern outdoor seating area. Walking inside you're greeted with the most amazing staff, and owners Brandon and Faith. The atmosphere inside has a warm, modern, and clean environment tone. From the custom artwork behind the barista bar, the custom round tables, and the comfortable seating with pillows, provide a comfortable environment for work, meeting friends, or small group gatherings. The drink and food selection are laid out neatly and clearly for people to choose from.  People Stepping in to the establishment, you're always greeted with the amazing staff and owners. From talking with them for as short as 5 minutes you could see and hear their passion for coffee and their business. They carefully choose where to get their coffee from and make sure the taste is up to their own standards. In addition, their baristas have a passion for the coffee and tea they create. Watching them make your personalized coffee is an experience in itself. You could see from their delicate movements, and attention to detail that they truly care about the drinks they create. Whether you're by yourself or meeting friends, you will always feel welcome by the amazing staff and owners.  Coffee ""Speechless"" As a disclaimer my go to drink for taste testing purposes is always a shot of espresso. Going into this establishment I was completely comfortable with the menu options. Unlike most coffee shops, I feel a bit overwhelmed with the amount of drinks they offer. But with Bird & Branch I felt joyful looking at the different, and unique drinks they offered. I love their fun, playful drink names that represent a different type of bird and its personality. But before ordering their fun, playful drinks, I of course had to order an espresso. To my fortunate surprise I fell in love with their coffee. They get their beans from Saint Frank Coffee located in California. Their espresso had this subtle sweetness tone, that highlighted the nutty coffee flavor. It had a tiny bit of bitterness, but that was immediately subdued from the aroma and subtle sweetness.  Using the same beans they were able to create the most unique drinks that I have yet to have. One of my absolute favorites during the summertime was the Sparrow which was a shot of espresso, and house made lemon soda. In addition, they made their own almond macadamia nut milk which combined with any of their signature drinks will sure bring out the flavor of the coffee and give your drink a unique and wonderful taste. Finally, every drink must be paired with their amazing pastries such as, their house made Kobocha Molasses Loaf, Clotted Cream Kouign-Amann, Custom Toast Fillings, or their light, refreshing, and fruity chia seed bowls!  There's so much more I can say about this establishment. But as mentioned in the beginning, this place is ""Breathtaking.""",5.0,11/28/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"I came here with a friend after having lunch nearby. I wasn't expecting much in terms of cuteness for the place, but it was actually really cute! There is outdoor seating and the place serves the drinks with reusable straws. Their inside could be brightened a bit more with natural lighting, but the decorations are still pink and pretty. As for the drinks themselves, I'm not a huge fan but I don't hate them. It's something that's good enough to get through a hot summer day.

The menu is also fun and includes creative drinks apart from the basics. There isn't a ton of seating (three tables and a couple bar seats against right wall) but if you do get a seat, it's a cute and quiet place to chill if you're in the midtown area and want to pretend you're not in midtown ha.

It's kind of a small shop, and there's not a ton of seating, so it's not a great place to work, but if you can snag a seat, it's very cozy.  The staff were very nice, and didn't make you feel like they were just trying to hustle you through (but they were still efficient!).  I got the iced macadamia almond milk latte, it was a little over $6 for what seemed to be about 16oz. Seems about right for the neighborhood since they're an independent shop. It was a good latte, but not very remarkable, I guess I just wanted more out of it.  If you want good pictures, make sure you get the drink to stay, the glasses/cups are very cute.",4.0,6/5/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769

They whisk their matcha powder with hot water which is what is traditionally and supposed to be done instead of stirring. I haven't tried other espresso items on their menu, but my mom has tried their latte and loves it! Their space is a bit tight, but there are a few tables here and there for working, but it's a little awkward staring straight behind the counter to the baristas/owners (haha).

The white textured decor accented with the life of plants and people make the coffee and breakfast a level higher than any other place in the area.

Definitely do the coffee flight if you can, to get a sampling of the offerings. Add some dessert or croissants and your day is set. I highly recommend a visit.  ----  Update: even after just a few months the cafe as grown so much! More coffee cocktails, more creative toasts, so much to try out every time!

Bird & Branch,5.0,"Such a wonderful spot to either have a coffee date or get some work done. This coffee shop has your basic espresso beverages as well as their own signature drinks. One of their signature drinks I had was the starling (hojicha tea cold brewed and carbonated). It was so interesting and really good! I love hojicha and their drink had a really nice twist to it. I also had their cappuccino which was bold and full of espresso flavor, not burnt and not milked down. Will definitely come back again. Their staff is friendly and patient in explaining their menu. They also have a wide selection of pastries and food that they may in house. If you're into earl grey, matcha, and black sesame, you'll definitely find something enjoyable here -- beverage-wise and good-wise. Seating is sort of limited, maybe three small 2 seaters, small bar seating by the window, and some lower coffee tables with chairs. Free WiFi!

The drip origin changes frequently enough, but it's always unique and never bitter. The shop also offers a decent pastry selection, with classic croissants to new, interesting pastries.

I looked at their options and decided to get a regular cup of coffee and a chocolate croissant. The cup of coffee was a good size but unfortunately somewhat bitter despite adding sugar [I rarely use] and skim milk. The croissaint was good [ the pastry options when I was there was limited to 5 with no signage distinguishing one from the other]. Another issue is that both items together were more than $8-the coffee was nothing fancy. It is pricey.

I especially loved the greenery on the walls and hanging from the ceilings that made you feel at home and like you could stay awhile.  I tried their non-dairy latte and it was honestly one of the best I have had. The coffee quality was superb (St. Franks from SF!) made with almond macadamia nut milk they make in-house! Non-dairy lattes are such a hit or miss, but this one was full of body, thick and flavorful. I didn't try any food, but saw a variety of chia puddings.

I had a hard time choosing an item, primarily because I was feeling a bit under the weather and had taken a benadryl as well....but I settled on the basic, a regular filter coffee. My other choice was the Robin because I am a big fan of ginger but it doesnt have any caffeine. However, I did get a taster sample of the Robin and it is AMAZING. Super flavorful (can definitely taste the ginger). I will have to come back and try it hot as I was told the hot option brings out more of the ginger flavor.  The regular drip is pretty good as well. Has a nice body to it and a different flavor than other drops that I've had. If only this was closer to my office, I'd include it in my weekly rotations.

My two favorite drinks are the Robin and iced matcha.  I really like that they use real and fresh turmeric in the Robin drink.  It's really rare to find a cafe that uses fresh and real turmeric.  It makes a huge difference in the taste!  I also really love the food options at Bird & Branch.  I have tried the avocado toast, ham & brie pastry, and miso hummus toast.  They are all delicious and healthy too.    I'm looking forward to becoming a regular customer and trying all the signature / seasonal drinks!",5.0,7/3/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,"My husband and I came to Bird & Branch for some afternoon beverages. He got a cappuccino and I got a non caffeinated robin. I was very pleased with my drink as it felt homey and tasty, perfect for a cold day. The ambiance feels bright and peaceful, with some seating areas adorned with comfy pillows. I like that they play light music so that you can easily talk without having to raise your voice or can easily read a book. It's a calm, but uplifting atmosphere - a nice break from the busyness of the city. The owners and employees are welcoming and friendly. Didn't get to try the sweet treats, but hope to next time!",5.0,3/22/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,The coziest spot with the best matcha and turmeric lattes!!  Midtown needed this so much. Please support them!,3.0,6/4/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769

Bird & Branch,5.0,"As we crossed 9th Ave at West 45th, we noticed the Bird & Branch off to one side and looked in. We were heading somewhere for coffee anyway, so we decided to give it a try.  We ordered our usual lattes and were intrigued by one of the pastries in the display case. It turned out to be a kouign amann, a sort of cross between a cupcake and a croissant. We ordered one (along with a chocolate croissant) to go with the lattes.  We've been working our way through all the coffee shops in Hell's Kitchen, and so far, the coffee we got at the Bird & Branch is the best of the lot (by far). And, as if that isn't enough, the kouign amann we ordered was delicious (the chocolate croissant being merely ok).  The people working behind the counter were super friendly and happy to explain things to the uninitiated. The interior is pretty minimal with a half-dozen tables and a earth-friendly vibe given off by the decor. We spent a comfortable 45 minutes enjoying our coffee and pastries and will almost certainly return for an encore when we next get the chance.",3.0,3/17/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769
Bird & Branch,5.0,Coffee is amazing (had the cold brew). Very nice selection of treats and breakfast items. Avo toast was one of the best I've had. And the sesame square is a must-try!

Bird & Branch,5.0,"What a spectacular new gem to the neighborhood! The shop is so inviting from its crafty, pristine, and meticulously designed interior to its friendly, knowledgable staff, and of course its delicious coffee. These owners surely know their product and are happy to answer any questions with their roasting process and all the other products they sell.  There are many business that are just one-dimensional: they just want to sell as much product as they can. I suppose nothing is particularly wrong with that as long as the product is good. However, this business is excels beyond having exceptional products. These owners truly know coffee. They are passionate about each product they sell, and are able to explain the full process about how each product they own is made. They are also mission-driven beyond selling great product to taking care of current and all future employees in their shop.  I highly recommend you visit this lovely business in Hell's Kitchen. Strike up a conversation with the owners for they are so easy and pleasant to talk to. Businesses like this one make the City, and surely the world, a better place.",5.0,2/21/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769

Bird & Branch,5.0,"I am such a sucker for cool vibes and different menu items, which this place rocks at, but I just can't justify $7 for a matcha affogato that is essentially 2 small scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with some matcha drizzle. It wasn't anything special and I definitely won't be ordering that again.  My friend got a vanilla latte and it was decent--coffee is smooth and not too acidic. In terms of basic coffee drinks, it's priced about the same as nearby spots (though I checked against UT47 and St. Kilda and this place is 25-50¢ higher on some drinks). I guess you're paying extra for the vibez~~",4.0,5/8/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769

Bird & Branch,5.0,"Bird and Branch is close to me, and unique so I like to bring my guest visiting here. I do find this place to be more expensive then other places around. I purchased a bag coffee beans today at 19.99 and they didn't offer a free cup of coffee like other local shops with a bag purchase. I would suggest implementing this into your shop to compete with other coffee shops around the corner. Other than that unique, great quality drinks.",4.0,12/30/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769

Bird & Branch,5.0,This was my favorite coffee shop I visited on a recent trip to the city (and I tried quite a few!). The shop itself was very cute and modern and the staff was extremely friendly! The barista that helped us was very knowledgeable and was happy to answer any of our questions (we now know the difference between peaberry beans and regular coffee beans). I ordered a latte with their almond/macadamia milk (made in house!) and my husband ordered a pour over with the featured Kenya peaberry and they were both excellent.,3.0,4/17/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769

Bird & Branch,5.0,We came in just to check it out since we live in the neighborhood. We got the macadamian latte and it was really good! I can't drink soy or regular milk so always have to go with almond milk and it was a nice nutty flavor that complemented the coffee taste really well - and they do it in house. The owner (I believe it was him) really knows his pastries! I also like their web page and how they really want to be a part of this neighborhood.

Bird & Branch,5.0,"I tried the Blackbird and it was very sour and tart. Coffee tasted almost like yogurt and I was pretty shocked at the first sip, but I thought it was a very interesting experience. My friend ordered the Nightingale and I liked that one more. Overall a cute cafe, but the biggest drawback is that they don't have a customer bathroom and there aren't that many seats, so it's a bit too pricy for a takeout coffee.",5.0,12/23/2018,40.7603019,-73.9907769

I wish more coffee shops in NYC would follow their lead, I've seen this in lots of other cities, and especially overseas. We're really behind the curve here, but good thing Ground Central is around to set the bar.  I got a dirty chai latte and loved it -- slightly sweet, and I could still taste the espresso, which doesn't happen at other places that dump sugar and caffeine into a cup and hope for the best. It was a really well made drink.  The space is great, it screams ""cafe"" as soon as you walk in, with the soft lighting and dark walls.

Ground Central,4.5,"Rude barista (brunette with glasses).  Waited for my drink for well over 15 minutes. When I asked about my drink, all she said is that it's coming and very defensively said that my drink takes longer to make. Another few minutes pass and then the barista asks me what drink I ordered. Turns out she forgot to make my drink but barked at me before when I asked about it.",1.0,3/23/2019,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,"Coffee is an understatement for NY.  A true staple, where every other block has a coffee shop, pretty much...  We were in Times Square and in needed of warmth and caffeine but most of the coffee shops had no bathrooms! So I would highly advise you to look into this before heading your way.  Little outside of Times Square, we were able to find this gem.  Pretty hipster vibe with cute art drawings, dimmed lighting, and comfortable seating.  Best of all, clean bathroom!  To access, you have to get the pin code from the cashier during your purchase.  Of course, their coffees were delicious as well.  You can customize as you like and be met with friendly service.",5.0,11/12/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917

Ground Central,4.5,"I really enjoy coming to ground central. Their HK location is much bigger than their Midtown East location, and is a great place to study or catch up on work.  They have a fair amount of seating (a bar by the window, a long worktable with approx. 8 seats, smaller high-top tables, and a few chairs/tables in the back ""library""). It gets crowded during the day sometimes, but in the approx. 10 times that I have been here, I have always managed to find a seat (albeit after a little bit of a wait).  By the tables in the front, they have a few outlets, but you have to be seated strategically. They also have free wifi, but I believe that only lasts an hour (they have the code by the cash register). The ""Link - NYC"" wifi also reaches the front tables and was pretty fast, if you're concerned about the wifi running out.  Their coffee is also really good. I like their lattes and they have a lot of gluten free options for pastries. I got the banana bread once, and it was fine (a little dry, but pretty typical coffee shop fare).  Overall, would recommend if you're looking for a good cup of coffee or a cozy cafe to work in.",5.0,1/12/2019,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,"Coffee was really good and fairly priced. Only giving it 4 stars because the guy that was writing orders on the coffee cup for the barista was very pushy and didn't answer my question about the breakfast items. He made the ordering experience very rushed in regards to my breakfast item, which might seem a little petty but I couldn't read the far right side of the board while I was in line for the coffee and had to read it once I got up to the pastry case.",4.0,3/20/2019,40.7637495,-73.9846917

Has a super comfy back room with ample study space, large tables and nice staff. The best part is the sort of old retro vibe you get. I felt like I was back in the 30's drinking black coffee and catching up on the latest news.  Price to experience ratio: 5/5. The atmosphere here is so dope. Considering the coffee is pretty flavorful and smooth, it makes for a solid deal. I paid $4 for a small cold brew, which is on par with other spots in the city. BUT other spots don't have this vibe. Check this place out, definitely! They've also got a Grand Central location, and I've heard that one is great, too.",5.0,9/5/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917

My boyfriend and I got matcha lattes with macadamia nut milk and they were delicious. I often think that my own homemade matcha is better than those of coffee shops, but they knocked it out of the park! I also love that they have so many dairy alternatives.  Their baked goods are also incredible! We tried a couple doughnuts (the carrot cake doughnut was INCREDIBLE) and a chocolate chip cookie which was sooooo good. The staff is also super nice.

At the risk of admitting my 'basic' tendencies, the apple cider latte is everything that's good about fall. The pastries are good, too.  What I particularly like about this place is that there's plenty of seating, arranged well for either individuals or groups to either relax or work. The wi-fi is consistently reliable, and there are even a few outlets scattered around (!!)  In a city where the combo of good coffee + seating + wi-fi + outlets seems impossible to find, Ground Central checks off all the right boxes. Highly recommend.",4.0,10/23/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,"Ground Central is a beautifully dark coffeehouse where people plant themselves like trees and watch each other, their phones and their books (in that order) in the after scent of bitter brews. Love it. Just when you think coffehouse culture is dead you stumble onto a place like this.  The coffee is, in a word, amazing, but that's secondary, this, this is a place you linger. With a great couch in the back and wingback chairs you'll absolutely melt in, this place is the perfect respite from the manic midtown energy and Starbucks blues. Sure getting a seat is as difficult as getting a rent control apartment but if your lucky to get one you'll understand and proceed to sit for hours on end just on principle alone.  Food is good, prices are a tad high but worth it, and who doesn't love a good pun when naming a place?",5.0,1/27/2019,40.7637495,-73.9846917

Price points are between 5-10$ for either a small coffee and a pastry. On this Friday morning, I came here to meet with a friend to chat.  It must have been the busy-ness of the morning but it was so loud with chatter and because the  music was blaring everyone's voice was louder than normal.

Ground Central,4.5,"Was here doing work for a whole day with a friend and was pretty disappointed.  The WiFi is exceptionally slow here. Also, like one of the other reviews mentioned, the music here is really dependent on who is controlling it. In the morning, it was way too loud for people trying to have conversations or study. However, the music level was fine by noon or 1pm.  My biggest qualm about this place is their food choices... They didn't have half the items on their menu all day long. Like what?? Why have them on your menu if you don't offer them???? Was pretty confused since they didn't seem that surprised or apologetic. Seems like it may be a pretty frequent occurrence that they don't have half the food menu items.  Drink I got was good and strong!",3.0,9/10/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,"While on my quest on trying different coffee shops in NYC that isn't a Starbucks or Dunkin, I stumbled on this place this morning. I came in and around 8ish there were two lovely ladies at the counter preparing for the morning. I've been looking on Instagram at their drinks and I was tempted to try their dirty chai latte. Only I didn't see it on the menu, the two baristas explained that they do make it and it comes in a powder form. Alsooo FYI because I noticed it's not listed under payments, they do take cash as well. It was delicious, and I loved the little heart that came on top as well. this place seems like a very cool setting to study, get some work done, or if you just want to drink a cup of coffee and relax. I've been walking past here on the way going/coming to work and home, and it does get crowded sometimes after 5:30. The ambiance is chilled, and there's also a seating area in the back where I saw people work on their laptops. I'll definitely be back here to try new things, between this and bibble & sip; I've definitely found my new favorite coffee shops. **side note, don't order a medium like me, lol.

Ground Central,4.5,"I walked 16 blocks out of my way, with my luggage in tow, to stop in at this location of Ground Central in between meetings.  With so many coffee joints in NYC, especially Midtown, Times Sq, and Hell's Kitchen, why would I bother?  Lemme tell you why...  When you walk in the door at 888 8th Ave (an auspiciously lucky number!), you already feel like you're home.  Cool music and friendly, engaging folks behind the counter make you feel welcome.  This was my second trip here in a month (I'm from Chicago) and it's hard to imagine going elsewhere.    Probably my favorite part is watching other customers.  They can feel the vibe, dig the excellent music, and most all break out in song or dance.  Baristas too.  Today, I was greeted by a tall drink of water, Chad.  He was very helpful, made smart suggestions to my broad, random questions (get the egg fritatta on brioche, BTW), and saved me from double dosing on my dirty chai.  Seamless handoff to Olive, the barista with the mostest, where she made a flawless almond milk dirty chai.  It was the PERFECT temp, smooth and balanced, and poured with love.  No, really, check out the heart in my pic.  :-)  Food is top quality as well so don't hesitate to add sweets and savories to your Ground Central experience.

Ground Central,4.5,I came here on a Monday evening for coffee with a friend. I was torn by the choices so I went boring and got drip coffee. The cashier was super nice and patient with me and my questions. Their prices are not super cheap but it's comparable to other coffee shops in the area. They have a lot of options and lots of milk options which is a plus! I saw macadamias milk advertised and that blew my mind!!  They also have food and salads. The interior is dark yet very fancy living room looking. I felt like I was in a living room and a university library all at the same time. They have tables  and seas right when you walk in as well as a back room with a couch and additional seats- ottomans and high back chairs. The bathroom is super clean and huge!  Just the bathroom alone is a reason for me to be a bit less loyal to Starbucks. I enjoyed my drip coffee and I felt that it gave me a serious jolt!! I'll definitely come back to try something else.,3.0,8/27/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917

They also have good selection of non-dairy milk alternatives (oat, macadamia). Atmosphere is also very nice with a lot of seating including a library like section at the back, though now so popular on weekends gets filled up!  My only complaint (and hence 1 star ding) is when taking drink orders there is no system for keeping track whose drinks is whose (name of person or number system). So when they call out large oat latte and 3 people had ordered large oat latte, there is confusion as to who was first in line and it belongs to. Please implement a person's name or numbering ordering system so it's fair FIFO principle for everyone picking up their orders. Make this fix and then 5 stars is deserved!",5.0,12/2/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917

The second time, they closed an hour early without warning, which was unexpected, because the late hours was one of the reasons to come here.  On the positive side, there is a lot of seating, and the staff is very friendly. The tea is pretty good, nothing too fancy, but definitely not outrageously expensive.

Ground Central,4.5,"I was in the area very early (for me anyway) at 7:30 and was pleasantly surprised to find this shop open!  I really liked the vibe upon entering, dark enough to be cozy but warm and bright enough to be welcoming for a rainy morning. It's got a very Brooklyn-feel for a Manhattan coffee shop honestly. It feels very comforting, like they'd like you to stay awhile, maybe that's to do with the oversized furniture, and the warm lights but it's very nice.  I was greeted by the barista as I walked through the door, and she gave me a second to check out their extensive menu. I ended up getting a small cold brew (they only have small and large in iced drinks). In the subsequent times I've been back whoever is at the register has always been friendly. The condiment bar was very well set up and in keeping with the rest of the shop. They were well stocked and had honey, which is always a plus.  The coffee as very good and reasonably priced and it seemed like a lovely environment. I'll definitely be back and try some of their other selections. I am pleased to have found this place!  I've now tried their hot drip coffee (excellent), cold brew (stellar), iced green tea green tea (perfectly brewed), and an iced latte (divine). I also had the berry scone which was delicious, perfect amount of density and sweetness.

The walls were painted black with amazing sketches all over them. You could tell there were regulars stopping in to grab their morning joe because the baristas knew them by name. This.

The music was old-school and tasteful. They use the darkness of the space to look cozy.  They have a big menu of espresso drinks, cold brew, nitros, and teas. I went for an espresso ($3.50). It came out within a couple minutes. A little bit bitter, but nothing that the well-kept sugar and spice shelf couldn't fix.  I asked for an espresso to go, but I can forgive them for accidentally giving it to me to stay. The plating was cute and the (ginger?) cookie was yummy. Nice to sit for a moment.

The donut was really good, it was kind of heavy and I only ended up eating less than half but that just means more for later. Cappuccino was really good - strong! They even put a little heart in the milk froth which is a cute touch. Prices weren't bad for a New York coffee shop.

Have no idea what it was, but it gave the sandwich a nice, unique kick. I also had their Nutella Brioche - and oh boy, was that good! I could have that all day every day.

Ground Central,4.5,"This coffee shop opened about a month ago and became my absolute favorite thing in the neighborhood the day I found it. The ambiance is unique and comfortable, the lattes are absolutely delicious and beautiful (who doesn't love foamy latte art) and the employees are really friendly and pleasure to interact! The first time I stopped in to check it out, I met Oliva, who was super nice and introduced herself, told me about the shop and made an exceptional latte I've been ordering seven days a week ever since. With so many coffee shop choices in the city, it's really exciting to have a go-to neighborhood place that's overall awesome.  To summarize: -Great coffee -Great employees -Awesome ambiance",5.0,10/28/2017,40.7637495,-73.9846917

With these hot summer days, it's a fab place to sit down in & get some work done. + they have this amazing couch and chairs in the back, with a bookshelf of amazing books! Been coming back here multiple times!",5.0,7/13/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,By far my go to coffee spot in the morning. Nevermind that there is a Starbucks across the street but I'd rather come by here. The decor the music the baristas all cool af. The many different choices of coffee is more than adequate for anyone. I personally like the cold brew and with nitro but my favorite is the dirty chai. Also their non GMO muffins and scones are also very good. Love this place a lot. Would love to just come here one day and chill out especially to the dope tunes they play.,5.0,7/3/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,"I love this place. Coffee is great, vibe is chill and artful (wooden tables, a giant mural on the wall, filament lights), and the guys are super nice and actually care about good service.

Ground Central,4.5,"Overall 5 stars Coffee 5 stars Baked goods 5 stars Atmosphere 5 stars Value 3.5 stars will i be back? Yes*  Needed a place to chill while the family was busy with other things.  found this gem via yelp.    Coffee: The coffee was excellent.  I assume (hope?) roasted on the premises?  Baked goods: i had only one baked good so take this fwiw.  It was good. :-)  soft buttery chocolate chip cookie, just the way i like it.  Atmosphere not much seating area, but not that big. The back has a few couches, and a bookshelf full of books.  If I lived nearby, i sense i would be coming here quite a bit to just read.  Value It was expensive.  I assume that's par for the course for manhattan, though.  will i be back? If I need to, and am in the area yes.  But I don't need to usually when i'm nearby.

Ground Central,4.5,"I was looking for a chill place to spend a couple hours talking and working with a friend and this place was absolutely perfect. Would definitely come here again.  ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE The music was soft, lots of seating (though it fills up fast), insanely friendly and charming service. The temperature was really warm and cozy so I never had to wear my coat inside, even though I was sitting near the door. The Wi-Fi was a bit spotty so I ended up connecting via my phone instead, but still lovely.  DRINKS/FOOD I got a sugarless matcha latte with almond milk, and it tasted exactly like it should. If you're someone who knows a lot about matcha and expects it as is (and not super sweet), this place makes it really legit. Highly recommend. I also got the frittata, which was yummy and the toast was nice and crispy.",4.0,10/3/2017,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,"Visiting NY from the ATL and needed a place to bring my laptop and get some work done. Walked about a mile from my hotel thinking my GPS did me wrong bc this place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's a perfect little NY coffee shop inside. Goes back quite a ways and there's window/bar seating, a large table which I worked at, and a quiet space in the back with some comfortable chairs and couches. A lot of space for this area. I had regular coffee which was piping hot and beyond decent, and an iced chai latte, which was delicious and not too sweet (closer to real chai). Didn't have any food, but it looked great and they had lots of options from baked goods to sandwiches.  Also noticed they have beer on tap so might just stay here.",5.0,2/25/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917

So disturbing. They also have a tempreture issue. The entire place is boiling so what do they do? Open the front door... MORE 8th ave noise.. cars honking, busses.. I r recommend this for a quick pick up.  (I first gave 1 star but giving the owner's quick feedback I think 3 stars would be more appropriate. )",3.0,9/22/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,Super nice people working here.  Came in on a rainy night and got a cortado.  Tasted great and the manager/owner Ganesh me a free berry pastry that was delicious.  Say at the big wood table and just enjoyed conservation with my wife and relaxed.  Great environment.  Drink was done right but to be 100% needed to be in a glass not a cappuccino mug.....being super picky here.  Great place good vibe nice people.,5.0,2/12/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,This place is awesome.  The staff here is excellent. Each time you walk in the door they are always ready and willing to take your order and be sure you do not have to wait very long. The decor  inside is different from other coffee shops and I really enjoy that. I would recommend this for a treat over Starbucks across the way. Definitely try it out. You really can't go wrong here.,5.0,2/4/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,"Stopped in for some tea and laptop time (yes, they let you use their wifi AND outlets!) on a crowded afternoon. Unable to decide whether I wanted a scone or a cookie with my tea, I asked the server to decide for me. To my surprise, I sat down to find he gave me BOTH! SUCH. A. FAN. OF. THIS. MAN. It's the little things in life, sometimes, and Ground Central has a new fan.  There are low, communal tables in the front and high-top, two-person tables along the side. Passing the counter around the back, you'll find plush chairs and a couch. The chamomile tea was everything I needed, the beautiful decor and comfortable seat completed the zen. And, most of all, the chocolate chip cookie was on par with Schmackery's.  Found a go-to.",3.0,1/18/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,"Nice coffee shop. I enjoyed their mocha and tried out their almond croissant - very sugary. I liked the atmosphere of this place - dark and music pumping. The music was kind of loud but their music selection was good so it didn't bother me at all. They seem to have plenty of seats for people to sit and do work. They have wifi too - the wifi is shown at the counter on the card readers. It's a bit of a walk here from my place, but I definitely plan on coming back. They had good coffee and an appealing atmosphere.",4.0,3/21/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917

Ground Central,4.5,This ground central recently opened on 8th Ave and its got a great address. Unfortunately I don't feel the same  about its coffee. I decided to give this place a shot even though I have been to the east side location several times and didn't like it.  I tried the Nitro here and it definitely wasn't what I expected. The Nitro erred on the sour side and wasn't very smooth or creamy-like.  The service was good though. The cashier let us know of their current promotion and was very patient as my friend and I were deciding on drinks.  Not sure I'm ready to make a second visit yet but I'm sure I'll try to keep an open mind and throw it in my mix.,5.0,9/27/2017,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,I was very impressed by Ground Central. I wasn't expecting too much because it's in midtown area. I walked in not really know what I wanted yet.

I would go back here.,5.0,8/10/2018,40.7637495,-73.9846917
Ground Central,4.5,"Place is nice and has a cozy area in the back with books and a sofa. Staff were pleasant.

When they opened they had a great promotion if you buy a pastry you got any coffee beverage for free. But I wouldn't get a pastry there anymore.

Turns out they just forgot to make it. Second time, I ordered a dirty chai. Same exact thing happened. They just forgot to make it. I just tried again with a hibiscus lemonade.

The Cortado I ordered was good so that wasn't an issue at all and they have a big table to study at which worked well. However, the music was very loud and there was a couple making out aggressively for 45 minutes in the coffee shop. The staff walked by several times and didn't say anything to them. It was really gross and distracting and I wasn't able to get anything done. I finally just gave up hope that anything would be done about it, packed up my stuff and walked out.

I was still hopeful but then the food arrived. The Quiche was frozen in the center and it was the size of a large mug; the greens were less than a handful with a drizzle of olive oil. The Chai was OK at best. I should've gone to a restaurant instead!  Fine, I said to myself. Bad luck. At least I can study here. But at 6:30 they turned off the light and stacked chairs in the back half of the Cafe. So I moved tables. (The Cafe closes at 8:30 according to the sign outside)  In short, if you need a place to sit and have an expresso.

You will notice many Chinese books on the wall, all the way towards the back. Come to find out this is first a bookstore/meditation place and then a coffee shop.  The coffee shop is owned by a non-profit organization. Their main focus is the book store and mediation sessions they have towards the back of the shop.  If you pass by in the mornings you will see a very nice guy by the name of Tony. He is whom I approached and asked him about the cafe. Take the time to talk to him, very down to earth chill guy.  Now about their coffee! It's great thus far. I've tried their tiramisu cafe latte and their pistachio cafe latte which both have been very nice. I've gone with those two options because for the time being they didn't have caramel which is my go to.  They have a great assortment of pastries. I have tried so far only the maple walnut danish. Very Yammy! Now I do want to try their homemade Tiramisu. Apparently it's prepared by their chef who is a young man from France .  Their cups are really nice, no handles.

Tianti Books,4.0,"I came across Tianti while searching for a place to do work before watching a Broadway show in the evening. This is a cute little Asian-inspired Cafe that seems to have a Chinese/Buddhist aura to it. Although categorized as a bookstore, I'd consider this place as more of a Cafe than a bookstore. I ordered a small Iced Matcha Latte ($5), and an Almond Croissant ($4.25). But were nothing too special, but definitely good items. I liked how the Matcha Latte was not too sweet at all, as I prefer mine to still have a himt of the natural bitter Matcha flavor to it. The biggest con about this place is their paid WiFi. I came to this place to do work for ~6 hours, and I was disappointed to find that WiFi was not free. It's $2.95 for 1 hour of WiFi, which I didn't find worth at all. If you need to do work with WiFi, you might as well go to the Starbucks across the street. Other than this one setback (for me), Tianti is a great bookstore that has a very calming/meditating vibe, and is a good place to sit and kill time when needed.",4.0,2/12/2019,40.753943,-73.992609
Tianti Books,4.0,"PSA #1:  you have to pay for WiFi here ! That is soooooo not cool, I don't know any place in NY where you have to pay for WiFi, that is absolutely ridiculous & will make your coffee shop the last resort to go to. PSA #2: they are extremely overpriced... even Starbucks is less expensive than this place. It seems they overcharge in order to make up for their lack of foot traffic-- which is apparent by the way. It's run by some unfriendly Asian lady that seems to only care to make a buck. The space is large, and they have nice tables to work on, but I have two main issues with this business. The main one is that it is not actually a legitimate bookstore as they claim. All of the book are basically just the same book but translated in all different languages. The book relates to some kind of religion, but I found it to be a bit uninviting for customers who may not follow that religion and are interested in other books (like a regular bookstore with books from all over the world) I wouldn't think a business like this would do well because of that. I recommend they grow their selection of books and this way I guarantee they will have more customers. Because the space is quite nice, but the music is bothersome & the books.. well.. there is none lol! The coffee and pastries are nice though. But they should really keep their sugars and condiments on the outside where people can reach/ use them, not hidden away behind the register.

You can hear water flowing in the background and ugh it's perfect for some afternoon werking. It was esspensiveeee, which was a given, but the matcha latte I got was mhmmm, not good at all. It was super watered down and it made me eek. Not into the drinks at all, but the space is super quiet and peaceful that it just makes you wanna work.

Tianti Books,4.0,"I needed a quiet place to go to before I take my bus from Port Authority. Unlike the super loud and crowded streets right outside, Tianti Books was VERY quiet and peaceful. I think it has like ancient Chinese meditation ritual books and sessions, but it's also a pretty extensive cafe. Though the drinks are quite expensive (over $5 for an iced latte) I'm used to paying that much for my coffee / anything away from the over-crowded street made me happy.  One thing I will complain about though is how cold the store is. I was wearing my very warm winter parka inside the store yet the tip of my nose and fingers were freezing up. This made me have to go get a warm tea, which I also paid close to $5 for, but the Tea Forte tea bags that they sell were SO cute! With their little green leaf sticking out of the cup, I just had to have it. The cold made my tea get colder quicker, but I still enjoyed it while it was warm. The wifi is also only 30 min free, so if you're trying to find a place to get work done for a long period of time, you may have to pay (I think it was around $2-3 for an hour).

He over-greeted to start- I walked in to look for my normal seat and an outlet - and he said hi like 8x as if he was scared I was going to start knocking tables over or twerking on them or something. The hi was really a 'why are you here.'  Then I saw the nice section in the back with the fountain was closed off and asked 'is the back seating unavailable?, wondering if it was a permanent change - he said ""bathrooms are only for customers.""  When I just stared at him - another lady behind the counter said - no that's not what she asked - and to me - 'he was confused'. Oh so now I need translators? Mmmkay.  POC reading you know the deal.

Just seemed by Yelp pictures that they were open for seating. Anyways, had to sit along the side of the long coffee bar as the tables in the back and front aside from the conference room areas were taken, so the place felt very narrow to me. My iced chai tea was... eh? The ice melted and it tasted... different. Wi-fi times out after 30 minutes, which is not cool since I was planning on staying for at least an hour. Music is... interesting. I'm usually not one to think much of what they play in coffee shops but the stuff they play here is not really my taste.",1.0,8/1/2018,40.753943,-73.992609

Not sure if this is a Falun Dafa backed book store/shop but there is nothing but Falun Dafa books in every language imaginable as decoration for the tall walls.  While it is neatly organized and aestethicgally pleasing, I just can't help but shake the feeling I was being indoctrinated and absorbing Falun Dafa via osmosis...anyways, THAT is my own personal view...but if you love Falun Dafa, I'm sure you would find it very calming.

Not a bad concept space wise but it was ridiculous to see a white man giving a meditation lesson based off Asian meditation techniques surrounded by books in Asian languages.  My friend ordered a $9 tea -- completely outrageous (I think it was a rose tea?) I didn't even know you could charge that much for a cup of tea. It was pretty good but nothing special. I ordered an earl Grey latte, which tasted extremely watered down and couldn't even be called a latte (it was basically tea with milk and sweetener). Also not worth the price (around $5).  The heat was also off THE DAY AFTER A HUGE SNOWSTORM. They were relying on these tiny intermittent space heaters that really didn't do much. My friend went to order another hot drink, and the guy at the counter finally got the hint and offered to turn on the heat.  That being said, it's generally pretty empty and a great place to work since it's quiet and spacious.

I was kind of excited about the place.  I thought...new small business. Hey, let me go support it.  I get there and everything is super expensive, but I said to myself, let me just try it. I got a medium regular coffee. It was smooth, but I didn't think it was worth the price.  I also got a pastry, which was OK, but it was overpriced as well. The bill came out to be $11.32 for a pastry, a medium house coffee, and 15% tip.  I am not a rich guy, but I sucked it up and ended up getting it because I believe in supporting small businesses.    I asked about Internet access.  The internet is ""free"" for the first 15mins. After that, you have to pay.  At this point, I wanted to leave, but I tried to justify all the prices because hey, it's Manhattan, and the rent here is skyrocketing.  I was there for about 20 minutes, just me working in the corner.  The place was empty.  Then I started to cough uncontrollably (I was just getting over a cold). I couldn't stop coughing no matter how much I tried to control it. I went to the counter to ask for water. They could clearly see me coughing in front of them. I was about to pop my eyes and lungs out on to the counter. Tap water. That's all I wanted. No, not just wanted. I needed that water. I've already spent $11.32 on a coffee and a pastry. And you'd think they'd give it to me after already spending that much. No.  ""Actually, that'll be $.35, sir.""    ...  To be fair, they came up to me after I stopped coughing and apologized. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't leave right away because I was in the middle of something on my computer.  I drank whatever coffee was left in my cup to stop the coughing, and finished my work.  They offered some water after the fact, and I refused because I was so angry.  As a former server myself, I would've left that water anyway just in case.  But what happened?  They bussed my table, and...took the water away.  All I know is that I will never come back to this place.  I am usually very happy to support small businesses, and I intend to keep supporting small businesses, even though I don't make that much money myself, but this place is making it very hard for me to keep doing so.",4.0,10/12/2016,40.753943,-73.992609

Tianti Books,4.0,"This place is like a hidden oasis among the chaos of the City. In my own personal opinion their latte's are seriously the best that I have had in the city. When you walk in it is almost as if it is something from a movie or book like Harry Potter or The Lion, the Which and the Wardrobe, it is as if you suddenly entered a different world or dimension. It is so peaceful and quiet and everyone is very nice. It is the best place I have  found to work or read without loud music blaring or hearing the crazy ones from the street.  My only complaint is that they are slightly more expensive than some places and they are not open very late. But really I don't mind paying a bit more for the awesome setting and environment. Great place to have deep philosophical conversations on life and our universe.  I wish they could open a lot more of stores around New York.

Prices aren't bad, and everything was ready within a few minutes. Latte is served in a glass mug and is the perfect temperature (no sugar necessary either). Pound cake is soft with a big carrot taste. Oatmeal cookie didn't have as strong of a flavor; probably not as good because I believe it was gluten-free.

I prefer Frisson (on 47th st towards 8th) for coffee and espresso or Amy's bread (around the corner on 9th) for espresso. For the price (over $5 for espresso drinks) it should be higher quality.  And now for the minor pet peeves, - It is named ""UT47 Coffee and Bread,"" but they have no bread, and the pastries are all pre-wrapped in plastic. Clearly, they don't bake them there, and I was disappointed the time I tried one. - The wifi never works - The decor in the main area looks like a nail salon. The area in the back and around the corner feels more like a coffee shop, but nothing about the place is cozy. - I've been in several times, and the owner/manager acts quite friendly, but just remember me. We've had 5 minutes conversations, then the next day, ""hi, first time in?"" - The extremely large and loud signs are just plain stupid. ""GIRL, YOU THIRSTY?""  And for the positives, - They are open late - You can just hang out in the back area or courtyard for hours - They have a bathroom (looking at you, frisson)",5.0,8/2/2018,40.7613128165844,-73.9899748563766

UT47,4.5,"UT47 cafe has an interesting setup. It's two-sided, partition by a wall connected in the back (horseshoe shape). On the left side where you enter, you'll see a semi-long table with chairs. Then you'll find the coffee bar and pastries all setup on the side. On the right side, you'll find two rows of individual tables where you can grab coffee with a friend or work on your own. Additionally, they managed to create a fairly spacious (at least for Manhattan), patio that provides a nice light atmosphere.  I was coffee'ed out and it was hot outside so I ordered an iced Honey Lemon drink, which could've had a bit more honey in it. My partner ordered an iced matcha latte. It was average, not extraordinary.  5 stars for the place. 2 stars for the owner/manager who gave my partner a nasty look and was judging him from head to toe when he tried to use the bathroom and realized you needed a code. Instead of explaining that you need a code, she said pretty rudely that you need to purchase a drink - as if he wasn't gonna buy anything when I was at the coffee bar about to place an order. She got real uptight and it was not cool. Maybe she had a rough day. I don't know but when a customer doesn't feel welcome, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.",5.0,6/29/2018,40.7613128165844,-73.9899748563766

UT47,4.5,"Walked a ways to get here on the premise there were macarons, great scones, and teas. The place itself is really narrow upon entrance, but has a much more open space toward the back, to the right. Unfortunately this was a coffee run on behalf of my team so there was no time to sit and enjoy the ambiance. The place is nicely decorated, very zen.  I asked the barista her favorite drink and was recommended the Taro Root Bubble Tea. It was unfortunately underwhelming. The drink itself is alright - doesn't taste special at all. $5.25 for a 16 oz cup of what tasted like taro powder and milk. The tapioca was really... really not good. I'm sorry. I would highly advise against having it in your drink. I suppose it's my fault coming to a coffee shop and trying bubble tea.  We also tried to order the macarons, looks like they come from macaron café, but they did not have any. We purchased some scones in their place that I tried, not bad. My coworker said the brownie was really good, though I did not try. Overall, was a miss with the items I ordered today.

I even saw the owner rearrange furniture so that people could sit outside! She brought a whole bench outside and brought them a pillow, so that they could be more comfortable. She deserves the most with how much she cares about her customers.  I ordered a cold brew, as they had just run out of iced coffee, and it's great! I asked for soy with it and went to go put my stuff down on the patio, and one of the employees came after me and asked if I could go tell them how much soy I wanted because they didn't want to accidentally drown my coffee in soy, which I thought was really sweet.  I talked to the owner for a minute or so, and she is adorable.  She told me that she just opened the patio today since she just finished it last night. The timing couldn't be better because the weather is incredible today.    The cold brew was great! It was super smooth and tasted perfect.  There is maybe seating for 15 people or so, with one communal table for 4-6 people.

On top of that the owner is such a sweet lady who will chat with you while you're waiting or standing around looking for a table. And if all tables are full she kindly asks other customers if they don't mind moving or sharing. She's like the Korean mother you've always wanted! After I was done with my drink she came around and poured me hot Korean tea as she did for all the other tables.

I understand that's how you ensure that people actually purchase something since the password is on the receipts, but it feels a little excessive and interrupts my work. One of the reasons I started going to this cafe is that it closes later than any other one I've found, but that extra time doesn't matter if I spend a half hour inputting the new password is then waiting for staff to figure out why it doesn't work, which is what I did yesterday.

A notes to preface my full review: I have not had coffee to-stay in UT47  UT47 recently opened up in Hell's Kitchen, so I had to step in and test it out. I stopped in for coffee and a croissant a few weeks after the cafe opened. The staff are extremely friendly and were happy to have my business. That being said, I wasn't very impressed with the coffee itself. The coffee had a watery taste to it; the price didn't live up to the product.  As I like to visit places at least twice before I review them, I recently stopped in for an iced coffee - my summer go-to. I paid $5 for a large iced coffee; the price was expensive for the size. The iced coffee was unimpressive; it tasted flat and lacked character. Still, the interior of the cafe redeems it from my mediocre coffee experiences.  The interior of the cafe is best summarized as modern, clean, and cozy. If you're looking to sit somewhere to work, I highly recommend the cafe!

However, I was recently disappointed to see that they are trying to subtly change their hospitality policies - last time I sat with a friend for a pot of tea they came when we hadn't even finished it to ask if we were ordering something else (pot of tea is $10), and now I saw that they deliberately covered up all the plugs so you can't charge devices. While it's fine if they didn't want to provide that, they originally had signs outside calling in customers for their free wifi and now they seem to be regretting it. It would even be better if they charge customers for using outlets rather than cover them up out of the blue...

I do have to agree with another comment where they say the music is a little loud. It's quite outside though. Depends what you're looking for.,5.0,8/5/2018,40.7613128165844,-73.9899748563766
UT47,4.5,"UGH everyone is SO sweet here. They have one of the most adorable outdoor seating areas I've ever seen. The staff are the best part, though.

UT47,4.5,"I came in for a hot tea and saw they had so many options! I was looking for some relief from a summer cold and the owner suggested some of their Korean teas. She mixed the lemon honey tea and the ginger honey tea. So good and soothing! They had all sorts of coffee and tea options, including bubble tea. This place has wifi, a patio, a clean bathroom, and a good amount of seating for a cafe. Definitely will be back!",5.0,1/20/2018,40.7613128165844,-73.9899748563766
UT47,4.5,"Wow- what a hidden gem in the heart of Hell's Kitchen. The first thing I noticed was the design- everything's super modern, clean and minimal--very pleasing to the eye. The lighting is perfect for reading or working on your laptop, which I noticed many of the patrons were doing. The noise level was great; music was kept to a soothing volume. The outdoor patio (hard to find in any cafe in this area!) was SO cute, guys. Coffee was ok, nothing amazing but not bad. I had a cheese danish and again also just ok. Hence the minus 1 star. HOWEVER their donuts are a must try- the maple waffle is divine. So I'm coming back for how comfortable everything looks, the donuts, and the people who work there- the staff people were the BEST- so friendly and happy. Great conversation with the head lady there who I believe might be the owner? They all work so hard and are clearly good people. Nice job UT 47!",4.0,8/8/2018,40.7613128165844,-73.9899748563766

UT47,4.5,"This place is great for studying! The spacious seating has excellent WiFi, large cups for drip coffee and nice staff. The bonus is that there's an outdoor patio in the back, that is very inviting and comfortable.  The music is good and soothing/hip... which helps beat out the occasional car traffic honking. They deserve the 5-stars though, so I didn't subtract for that.  Randomly, they also have halva donuts, which I haven't seen too many of in the NYC area... not sure how they are bc I can't afford the calories lol",5.0,7/1/2018,40.7613128165844,-73.9899748563766

The service was very friendly here, and the interior was nice too. It looks super small when you walk in, but rounding the corner, there are many more seats! So this is a good place to enjoy your coffee and complete some work at the same time. The wifi is good and the password is shown on the receipt.

UT47,4.5,"This coffee shop is like no other.  As a Cali native and newly NY settler, I was in dire need of finding a cafe. I now have to look no further.  The coffee, hospitality, hours, & space is perfect. The coffee is tasty & strong, which will keep you alert to finish your work. Also, the owner Mi-Young & Hok (I think that's how you spell their names [if not I apologize in advance you two!]) are nothing but great. Do you plan on working? Yes? Go on and visit! There are several outlets located by each table inside & if you need fresh air to do work, there's a patio as well.  Honestly, this place fits all the criteria of an ideal study cafe. However, I would suggest one thing: more mellow music.  I have found my home cafe. Thank you!",5.0,8/20/2018,40.7613128165844,-73.9899748563766

The space looks small when you walk in and order at the counter, but when you walk around the corner in the back, there's a whole other space with chairs and tables. The cafe is cozy and cute. There's a nook in the back with a comfortable bench. I've seen other people come here to do work on their laptops or read.  The tea selection is pretty good, and the owner is friendly.

UT47,4.5,"I'm so, so torn because I don't want this place to become overrun and uninhabitable, but I also want it to stay open forever, so I know it needs customers in order to do that. Sigh. If you want an anonymous coffee shop where a beleaguered employee hands you your latte in silence, then this is not for you. This is for when you want to bubbly owner to compliment your hair color for five minutes and rearrange tables for your convenience.  The decor is cute, there's a bunch of outlets, the wifi is speedy and wonderful, and I've been here for maybe 3 hours on one cup of coffee-- which is EXCELLENT (shocking, the coffee is good at a coffee shop?)  A note-- card minimum is $5, which I don't think is unreasonable. Because they just opened, they let me get away with being under just this once. ;)",5.0,7/10/2018,40.7613128165844,-73.9899748563766

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"Cute coffee shop with great coffee! This coffee shop actually doesn't feel like NYC; it feels like Seattle (where I'm originally from). It's pretty quiet and mellow inside with old jazz music playing, and there wasn't too much of a line even though I visited in the morning. The baristas are super friendly too (also probably why it feels more like Seattle haha). It's definitely more of a take-out-and-go kind of coffee shop, but they have seating available for about 10-15 people. It's really clean and bright here; I can see myself working or reading here.  The coffee tastes really good, but their baked goods selection is good too. They have pastries (croissants, muffins...) and cookies (fruity pebble cookies, rainbow cookies, red velvet cookies...).

Regular drip is great and I had a decent chai tea latte. Almond croissant was also pretty good. Only thing I wasn't into was a salad from the cold case; the dressing was odd. Otherwise no complaints. Very limited seating so you'd best take it to go.  Definitely will try the cold brew soon, and those cookies!",4.0,3/9/2019,40.7578419,-73.983183891235
For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"In a town where great coffee places are literally on every block, this one is just barely above average. .  It has all of the warmth of a 19th century diphtheria ward. That's not aided by the equally hip duo who work the coffee bar in that us-against-the-public kind of way that they have that barista force field up where they chatter to each other, and open the invisible door long enough to deign to take your order.  High ceilings. White, and very sterile, with the usual pseudo-clever hipster homage to the five boroughs, and a huge back wall with faux-intriguing wallpaper of artists art and art in motion, scattered over a two-story high white space. All countered by a smattering of dark wood at the counter and the waste stations.  They have four tables and a wall bar in this massive space. Even emptier on a chilly Saturday morning, the tables are dirty and unattended. Man-bun-boi grabs a bottle of windex to clean the hospital walls, but never touches a table. When it got busier they patrons cleaned up to find a place to sit.  The lack of tables, and their disregard for them suggests that you move on. That's easy on a bustling spring day, but not when it's 12F outside. Their doors and the main door to the street are not well built for cold days. Every time someone came in, a ride of cold air swept through this over-lit hipster mausoleum.  For a place with a paucity of pastries, you would think that the coffee would be better. It's low acid, but it lacks flavor, depth of any character, and it would probably help the guy with the man-bun to use a thermometer so the milk isn't tepid.

The espresso comes out at the right temperature (somewhere between warm and hot, but never actually hot) Also, the espresso is never bitter. It is strong in flavor, but has a smooth finish.  The staff is very efficient and often friendly.  They also have some light sandwiches and salads as well as some pastries.  They do have some really awesome cookies, too.

They roast their own beans and the coffee is incredible. The cold brew is especially amazing (just as good as Stumptown's, but slightly different).  I noticed that everything here is high quality, from the sturdy cups and straws to the awesome napkins. I also think the patterned cups and cup sleeves are look pretty aesthetic.

At any new coffee shops that I try, I go for cold brews and americanos. Both are solid choices are here! I drink all my coffee black and without any sugar or dairy.

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"I got the matcha latte with macadamia milk - unfortunately the milk itself doesn't taste very strongly of macadamia (whereas almond milk is very strongly almond-y), and the matcha is lacking in concentration (i.e. too much milk which causes the drink to just taste like flavored milk).  The staff here were not very friendly or helpful, no one talks to you aside from taking your order - it gives off a very cold feeling (when you're used to coffee shop baristas having an open and welcoming feel / persona).  If you take a look at the menu, it's very confusing because a latte is 4.25/4.75 (which is made with espresso) whereas a matcha latte is 4.75+0.50 = 5.25 (which doesn't have espresso but does have matcha). It's a very odd way of pricing - I would have felt better with a more transparent menu that states a matcha latte is 5.25 rather than their weird ""matcha shot"" +0.50 line item.  Either way, I'm sticking with other matcha options in the cafes less than one block away or just making my own from now on.",5.0,7/28/2018,40.7578419,-73.983183891235
For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"An unexpected oasis in the heart of Midtown.  My coworkers always come here when we want a bit of a walk, because ""getting coffee"" is never really about getting coffee, it's about taking a step off the desk, gossiping, and treating yourself. It's a step up from running across the street to Financier or Starbucks. The space is all blond wood and artsy touches, from the cafeteria-letter menu to the hip wallpaper to the graphic design of the products. Very few seats, though, and most people grab and go.  I've now worked my way through almost two punch cards, largely by getting matcha shots. This is the only source of frustration that I have-- if you're with a group and the shop is busy, they will usually put off making it until the end since it's a bit of a hassle to mix. Their matcha is good quality, though expensive at $4, so I would rather get a fancy coffee creation for $5. (Pun intended.)  I just tried the ""Five"" today-- espresso, drip coffee, chocolate, and orange peel. I like the bittersweet flavor, though it's a lot of caffeine for me.

They're also on ritual too, so I sometimes swing by and pick up my coffee. However, the staff here is very friendly so I enjoy my experience whenever I do order in person.  For instance, one day I ordered my coffee and this purple cookie caught my eye on my way out, so I asked what it was and the barista told me it was a Cookie Monster cookie and explained how it was sugar cookie on the outside with chocolate chip cookie on the inside.

This gem is everything that could make your mornings more cheerful than your average, depressing wait in Starbucks. I also used to go to Simon Sipps in my office building until I found a place with a more creative menu. Cue For Five Coffee Roasters!  The drinks are well-executed with the utmost attention by the baristas. You could really tell that the team work together instead of doing things in a mundane assembly line fashion. My favorite drink is the Dona Chai latte on the menu. It has a nice, spicy tang to every taste. Not too sour and not too spicy. Note that you can also purchase the chai concentrate from Whole Foods (closest is the Bryant Park location) - which retails at a cheaper price. Otherwise, I also get the cappuccino with soy milk - topped with a velvety layer of foam.  The decor is bright, open, and fun. The waiting area creates enough space for you to walk around and stare at the high ceilings. The last thing on my mind is to take a break and go to a coffee shop that's cramped with angry corporate people. For Five Coffee Roasters make sure that this is the perfect cubicle getaway for you.

On a recent weekend trip into the city, For Five Coffee Roasters was the place I went to for this experience.  Set inside a larger, modern looking building, this space is very bright and elegant looking.  The large glass in front lets light pour in and the seating is very comfortable with a series of tables and seats set up in a small area towards the back where you will even find some power plugs to charge up your phone.  The staff was very nice when I asked them questions.  I bought a coffee (served in a mug when you eat in) and a yogurt with fruit.  The yogurt was great, but there were too many sweet elements in it (such as raisins and other dried fruit) for my taste.  I would have liked more yogurt and less of the fruit, but that may just be my personal taste.  The coffee was very good and full of flavor.

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,Great coffee!!  Great staff!!  Their coffee is roasted in the heart of queens. A different variety of coffees are available on location. Some of the best espresso I've had in years. Smooth aftertaste and not as bitter as all the mainstream espresso out there. I also had a cold brew that was out of this world. They also have a selection of sandwiches and pastries that I will have to try on another visit.

I kicked in a bit earlier than their usual open time, yet everyone was ready to serve their great coffee.  Their menu was quite extensive - aside from the regular espressos, they also serve signature lattes, and of course, the renown matcha latte.

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"I'm constantly complaining about the dearth of solid coffee shops in the Bryant Park area...well, WAS complaining, because For Five is the answer to my bitchy prayers.  Roasted in NYC, and just about everything here is an homage to NYC - from the logo reminiscent of old subway tokens, to the wallpaper summing up my years of people watching here.    The most important part is that the espresso is good. Real good.  Sure, it's fun to see a latte made using spouts coming out of the countertop, but the latte had better kill it - and it did. Baristas are clearly proficient.  There's adequate seating and a nice vibe. Whole beans for sale, with many blends to choose from, alongside barista favorites like the Acaia scale & Bodum French press.  There's a pretty solid food menu that I'll have to return for.

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"Local roastery from my borough gets their own coffee shop in Midtown! That' a win for For Five.  Midtown is getting infiltrated with more and more small coffee shops (watch out Starbucks!) and having For Five is a great option to the growing list. The baristas do a wonderful job with their craft. Having a good barista can bring out such finesse in what comes out and the flat white was superb. As a coffee aficionado, I'm always game to trying new coffee and For Five is a welcome addition to the coffee scene in NYC.  The decor is cool, modern with the monochromatic black and white and wall with the dice. There's plenty of space in the back to hang out too if you want to bring a group of friends or your laptop to do some work.

They really make it feel like a neighborhood spot. A true gem in, not too charming, midtown Manhattan.  Besides the great service, I LOVE the coffee. I mix it up between hot, cold brew and sometimes a matcha latte. All fantastic. The coffee is made behind an open bar, you can tell they really make the coffee with love and care.  They have almond milk(!!) out by the other milk, lids, sleeves, sugars. The napkins are very nice quality(odd thing to notice, i know).  The baked goods are so tempting everyday. I try something now and then. Everything is so fresh. The chocolate scone is amazing!

Unfortunately no cappuccinos :-( like most artisan coffee shops, they haven't mastered a cappuccino which is ""not"" a latte.

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"Great coffee spot with a lot of TLC going into the making of the beverages. Place can also draw quite a crowd sometimes so you end up getting caught in the doorway which is not the best line configuration in my mind. While the drinks are good, For Five is a bit sterile and doesn't have that warm and cozy vibe inherent in many coffee joints. Maybe the vaulted ceiling or everything being very white, which doesn't do it for me. So I pick up and go. Oh, and I am not always a big fan of this purist only one size being served.

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,I seriously thought about rating it a 4. I have to say since being in New York this is the freshest coffee I've ever tasted. It's rare to find a service that tastes like the coffee just came off the roaster. I considered rating it a 4 for the following reason:  -The service is inconsistent. The manager has been phenomenal and welcoming every time I've gone in. The rest of the staff however lacks the same enthusiasm or even welcoming gestures. This effort to connect is important.  This coffee shop has done what many can't in the quick hustle and bustle of New York. It's not a sit down place. But it's damn good coffee. This pails in comparison to anything like Starbucks. If any improvements were made it would be to possibly offer a pour over option. The coffee speaks for itself which is why I rated it 5 stars. Well done!,5.0,8/28/2017,40.7578419,-73.983183891235

You can tell a lot of thought went into the appearance of For Five; that said there's also a lot to be said for the functionality -- I loved the fact that they left drains for you to pour out coffee by the creamer/sugar stations. Their machines are definitely top notch as well and the baristas take their time to make sure that your order is to spec. If you don't believe me, try their lattes -- you can really taste the quality of the espresso. The chocolate and plain croissants are also perfectly buttery and flaky.  Apart from that, I'd have to say my favorite thing about For Five is the fact that you get your sixth drink free if you grab a punch card -- most places require you to buy at least ten, so this has definitely encouraged me to stop by a little more than my wallet would like!",5.0,3/25/2017,40.7578419,-73.983183891235

For Five Coffee Roasters,4.5,"There are many good things about this new business in midtown and hopefully it will be your new coffee shop to go. First of all the service: you can compare the service of this coffee shop to a 5stars hotel. I work in this kind of place so I can tell you that the service is really important ...even in a coffee shop. You are welcomed by the owners when you walk in and their enthusiasm and passion for coffee is immediately shared with you. It is great that they provided this service because you can only leave the place in good mood. They are really proud of their product and their store and will be more than happy to take the time to share their knowledge with you. Secondly the coffee shop: it is new so it is very clean and spacious. The owner was telling me about the fresque on the wall fronting the baristas desk. Drawings from an artist from New Zealand. The artist even drew the owners which I thought it was funny. In the back, they have a couple of tables. The wall is covered w/ dominos which is pretty cool. The thing that I really liked was at the Baristas desk. Their espresso can be served either wayfrom a normal espresso machine or served like draught beer. Go there to check yourself. Now the coffee and the food: I got a hot americano which was perfect with the weather. Very warm (not too hot like some place do) and delicious. I also had the chance to try their sandwich. Also very good. It is very nice place to have a quick lunch. Again the owner is very attentive to what the client wants. When he recommended me a sandwich he made sure I did not have any allergies. When you treat your client like that, you can only recommend the place to your friends and colleagues and wish them success.",5.0,11/1/2016,40.7578419,-73.983183891235

They offer almond and oat milk (no soy milk), so I decided to try out the Chai tea latte with oat milk (my first time)!

It's the chocolate chip cookie you failed to bake at home when you were a kid, the one you saw on kids shows/movies, and the one that pops in your head when I say 'chocolate chip cookie'.  If you want a really good, simple chocolate chip cookie, get this one. It's not mindboggling or one of the 'best' cookies in NYC, but we're human.

The maple was just not good to me at all in the chai. The only flavor shot option she said they had was maple and vanilla. Should have gone classic with the vanilla!  The 3 is because it was clean, quiet and the woman was so friendly to me!  Side note: I went around 7:44am and the cookies weren't done yet.

Culture 36,4.0,"It's good to be back in NYC enjoying the hustle and bustle in another amazing coffee shop :) This is a branch of the amazing Culture Espresso, and is located along midtown-West side. Pretty close to Penn station if you're looking for a good pick-me-up in the area. This shop is a small space, but decent size for NYC. Depending on the time of day it can be busy or slow. When I arrived there was a small line and seats were filled inside. But after a few minutes of waiting I was able to get seated with a friend. There's a large glass window with booth seating to people watch or have a good convo, and there is a large table space in the center for people to do work. There are a few 2 people seating tables along the side as well for those who want a bit more privacy.  The coffee is AMAZING here. The baristas are fantastic. They make amazing espressos in a quick amount of time in the business of the lines of people. And they get their beans from Heart Coffee Roasters out in Portland, Oregon. For those of you who are still new to the coffee world - let's just sat Heart Coffee is one of the best out west, if not in the states :P I ordered a macchiato and was made to perfection :)  They are also known for their amazing Chocolate Chip cookies and Oatmeal Cranberry cookies. My friend ordered the chocolate chip cookie, and I had a few bites of it :P It was delicious! It was nice and warm on the outside, and warm and gooey on the inside with a ton of chocolate chips. Macchiato and cookie - my cup of tea. The barista also told me they won the Cookie Competition this past year..apparently it's the new cookie and better than Levain Bakery's cookie now! I have tried both and going to be honest - hard to judge which is the better cookie. All that to say, please do yourself a favor and get a cookie with your espresso drink..you won't regret it. They also have amazing baked goods around the City from places like Ceci Cela, Blue Sky Bakery, Ovenly, Dough Doughnuts, Corner Café, and Magpies.  There are also two more locations in midtown-west area. I haven't checked out the other places, but imagine it's just as amazing.

Interior itself is quite minimalistic, with limited seating and a short, simple menu as well. The music is pretty loud here so probably not the best place for people to do work if it's distracting or to catch up with someone. Definitely recommend if you're trying to grab and go though.  Coffee is pretty average. I had an iced americano and there wasn't anything special about it to me, but it was smooth and didn't have that sour taste that a lot of other coffees in the area tend to have. The cookie is definitely the selling point for this cafe though! It goes for $3 a pop and it's definitely worth! They're nice and crispy on the outside, but have the right amount of softness and chewiness inside. The cookie isn't too thick so it's not overwhelming and they're about the size of your palm (maybe a little bigger).

Pretty standard or slightly cheaper than other places who charge more for non dairy milk. The rest of the menu is your typical espresso drink menu.  Store itself is average size- there are a few seats (maybe 10-12 or so total including the window seats?). Chill hipster vibe and clean design. The cookies look amazing! I think I saw vegan ones before but not this time. They also have a few other sweet pastries to go with your coffee!  Overall a solid choice for coffee in the midtown area.

There is a good amount of seating for a cafe around this area, and although it's conveniently by the chaos of Herald Square, it feels separate from all of the noise. There is also free wifi! The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food selection was mostly pastries and sweets, as opposed to maybe a more well-rounded menu, but the food was also decently priced! All around $3-$4 dollars.

So I go back today, about two weeks later. And I make sure to ask for a FRESH cookie. The man says it's fresh. I feel the cookie and it is stale. I tell him it's hard, he assures me it's his recipe and it'll be soft when I open it. He doesn't even look at it or offer a fresh one. I'm well aware it was a stale cookie and when I break the cookie open outside, sure enough, it's stale. As someone who's worked in customer service, I was really off put by this mans dismissive attitude, especially given that he apparently invented their cookie. I guess it was a still an OK cookie, but you can get much better with three dollars and fifty cents. Actually, you can get better for a dollar prepackaged cookie in your local bodega.

We sat for about 45 minutes on their bar stool seats, and they felt comfortable enough, although I can see how others would say it is not the best place to conduct a work session.  But as a respite from the cold?  Definitely a good choice!  I had their hot chocolate; the barista took his time making it and I felt slightly stupid when I said, ""pretty!"" once I had it in hand.

I ordered a maple mocha ($5) because they don't really do flavored drinks, and it was delicious as well as beautifully served. I sat at a stool in front of the window for three hours and it was the perfect spot to people watch, though it did get a bit cold sitting by the door.

2Beans,4.0,"I had the chance to try this 2Beans location in midtown while catching up with a friend who was visiting the city. I've walked by it a handful of times but never had the opportunity to step inside until this experience. I was always enticed by the idea that they served coffee beverages at what looked like a typical bar seating arrangement. Regardless, I took the chance and told my friend to meet me there even though it was my first time trying out the spot. I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.  My friend and I walked in around 5:45 PM on a Thursday afternoon. It was fairly dead at the bar on their first floor and while we were there only one other party ended up walking into the space. They also had an interesting set up in which they allowed us to sit at the bar and order our drinks there before paying for them. This was definitely a more casual bar-esq setting than most coffee shops in the city claim to be.  My friend and I both ordered their ice coffee ($4.45) which was presented to us on a tray with accompanying water and a small chocolate. So surprising! It's definitely the small things that count at restaurants and cafes and even though this wasn't too monumental of a gesture it definitely was appreciated.  The space itself is actually two floors with a small main bar on the first and additional seating on the second. They have an array of coffee products placed throughout the first floor that you're able to buy as well.  The service was great here too! The barista's were extremely friendly and didn't hesitate to answer any questions we had. I'd definitely recommend the spot if you're looking for a more unique place to grab coffee with a friend at. They also have alcoholic beverages that you can order as well if you're in the mood for something with a little bit more kick than your average cup of joe.",5.0,7/6/2018,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4.0,"After a morning at Starbucks, I decided to have a change of scenery and moved down the street from the mainstream to a nice cafe recommended by my sister's manager. 2Beans not only specializes in coffee, but also in chocolates. Here to study and grab a coffee? Why not also get a few chocolates? Many people were here for meetings or just meeting up on a date.  There are no outlets upstairs, which meant my time would be cut short when my computer died.  There's quite a bit of seating upstairs, while there is nearly no seating downstairs. You aren't allowed to use your laptop at the bar counter, which means there are only two tables you can use your laptop.  I placed an order of a rosewater latte with the server that took so long, that eventually, she also brought me a complimentary raspberry dessert to make up for the slow service. It was pretty nice of her, although I wasn't a huge fan of the cake. I did enjoy the complimentary 2Beans chocolate that each beverage came with.  The rosewater latte was tasty, although as others have mentioned, the rosewater is pretty subtle. But I'm glad, because I'm sure that a strong rose flavor may have come across as soapy. I stayed for a couple of hours, so I ended up ordering a cappuccino, as well.

Whether it is before work or after work, I like to stop by 2Beans for a cup of latte. I tried a number of different ones but here are my favorites - Lavender Mint Latte, Matcha Latte, and the Rosewater Latte.  Lavender Mint Latte has a nice, gentle floral aroma with a mint following. It has just the perfect amount of sweetness. I love to have this drink when I am stressing out at work, it helps calm my mind down.  Matcha Latte. It uses Ito En's matcha powder, a Japanese tea brand. Its bitter-sweetness is just the perfect combination for my taste buds.  Rosewater Latte. This is probably my ultimate favorite drink here - hot or iced. Perfect amount of fruity sweetness for my taste buds. A must-try!  There are coffee bar seats and tables located in the back.

2Beans,4.0,"2Beans is both a chocolate/sweets/coffee store as well as a small cafe upstairs that serves everything.  I came here last week for the first time because my mom had a Living Social coupon for two glasses of wine, a chocolate sampler, and a $5 gift card. We had a great time and I would definitely return if we got that deal again -- it's on the pricey side without a discount, but it's a cute place in an otherwise pretty corporate neighborhood.  If you do the Living Social coupon, you can choose glasses of any white/red/rose wine and you get a chocolate sampler, which is five pieces for the two people to split. They asked if we had any allergies, and since we didn't, they brought us their classic sampler (chocolates with hazelnut, ginger, passion fruit, etc.), as well as a knife so that we could split ones that we both wanted to try. They were delicious!  The chocolate selection downstairs is awesome -- a huge cabinet full of truffles in super unique flavors as well as a long wall with various types of interesting bars of chocolates, some $3 and some $20 or more. This is a great place to go if you're looking for a little present for a chocolate lover, a chocolate stocking stuffer, etc. Wide range of brands and price points -- cheapest is 2Beans brand chocolate bars, which are just under $3 each.

2Beans,4.0,"This is truly a GREAT chocolate store! They not only have a wide selection of chocolate bars, and chocolate covered items (pretzels, nuts, etc) but their chocolate truffles are always changing! I've tried green tea truffles, champagne, caramel and even fruity ones here. I used to come with my boyfriend every week for a few months to try the new varieties! I've also purchased some hot chocolate here which is my family's new favorite!  The espresso bar upstairs is also lovely. You can order a delicious hot chocolate (really very decadent) or a nice espresso drink to have with your chocolates. Their selection of teas is also lovely, with many imported teas and companies you've never heard of (mostly swiss and european). Really very delicious on all fronts!  A must-try for tourists, sweet-lovers and New Yorkers!",4.0,4/10/2017,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4.0,"One day I was around Park Ave and stumbled upon this chocolate/coffee shop, and I absolutely loved it! I thought it was like a Starbucks kinda coffee shop where you order your coffee and serve yourself, but when the cashier asked me if it was for here or to go, I said, ""For here."" Then, I found out there was a whole other floor above this shop. It has a clean, modern layout with a variety of table sizes and chairs. Some seats were comfy, cushiony sofas, but I opted for a seat against the ledge and ordered a macchiato while I studied my GRE.  Surprisingly, there were quite a large flow sitting in around 7/8am. Many seemed like corporate workers with suits and ties while some looked like tourists or travelers as they had a carry on luggage. I mean 2Beans is conveniently located by Grand Central Terminal.  I ordered a macchiato that was served in a sleet, clear glass with a piece of chocolate. It was about $6 with tax and tip. I'd say it's a little more on the pricier side since (I think) coffee is about $4/5 on average in NYC. But the beautiful environment and attentive service definitely made it worthwhile.",4.0,3/3/2016,40.7511373,-73.978866
2Beans,4.0,"As part of my commute home, I've walked past 2beans barely noticing what it was until one day I looked closer and saw it was a cafe, so I decided to try it.  When I walked in I knew this place was inappropriately named as their abundant chocolate selections take up nearly half the 1st floor!  I'm thinking to myself...get ready for something tasty.  I decided to forgo the retail store section which is filled with many different chocolate bars, chocolate pastries, and chocolate candies, and head to the cafe section.  I ordered a regular large cup of coffee and one of the multitude of delicious looking fresh pastries in the form of a nutella tart.  Shockingly I've never tasted illy coffee and after tasting it I couldn't help but be a little sad in realizing what I was missing for most of my life.  It was great coffee; a very nice mild soothing blend that calmed my caffeine cravings.  I had the nutella tart and it was an perfect accouplement to the illy coffee; not too sweet, nice outer crust, and just large enough to satisfy most people.  A really nice touch as part of the eat-in service is that 2beans supplies a nice complimentary cinnamon crumble bar and a small glass of water with orders.  The water really helps clear your palette after a cup of coffee; something I do normally anyways.  Speaking of the eat-in service, you have the choice of eating at the ""bar"" counter or going to the 2nd floor.  I suggest the 2nd floor as it was nicely decorated in simple modern comfy furniture (love-seats and comfy couches) and neutral colors; think of it as an upscale IKEA look.  Prices weren't too bad considering 2beans is located in midtown Manhattan adjacent to many financial and law firms.  2beans has plenty of competition though considering the prolific number of cafes and Starbucks in the area (yes, hedge fund gurus and attorneys crave caffeine).",5.0,12/16/2016,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4.0,"I'm not that particular with my coffee but I really like their coffee - so much so that I got it three days in a row. It's just as strong as Starbucks coffee for me, but I find that it tastes better. I love their croissants, but I just wish it was bigger in size since croissants are mostly air. I could probably eat 3 no lie... On the other hand, I tried their strawberry hibiscus muffin and it was so sickeningly sweet. The price is a little high in my opinion - $6 for a small hot coffee and a small croissant. The service is also not the best - the guy who poured my coffee today just kind of tossed it on the table and some of it spilled over the lid, which is annoying. You also have to ask for the stoppers, as they don't have it out. Also, their credit card machine needs work - doesn't take chip and it's kind of slow. Sometimes there will be a line and there is only one register open.  Overall, I like this place and it's convenient from my workplace, but it's a little pricey for what you get and the service/experience is just okay.",5.0,6/30/2014,40.7511373,-73.978866

Conveniently located in Midtown, very close to the NY Public Library and even closer to Grand Central Train Station. The place is not only a coffee shop, but also serves quality wine and chocolate. The interior is beautiful, though seating is a bit crowded. I chose to sit at the bar and watch the expert baristas at work. The atmosphere is classy and very upscale. My latte was served with a piece of chocolate, which was also amazing. Truly one of the best cups of coffee that I have ever had (and I've had many).",3.0,12/28/2015,40.7511373,-73.978866
2Beans,4.0,"The disclaimer:  I work in the coffee industry.  I'm not to going to write any bad reviews on coffee shops - I'll keep those opinions to myself.  Nor will I write about anyone that I do business with, or even might do business with.  So when I do write a coffee-related review, it will be a positive review, and one I write with an especially critical eye.  I stopped in here unscheduled, killing some time before a meeting in midtown.  What a lovely surprise.  The entrance could be tricky - after passing thru the outside door, you could go left or right - turn left.  The long space formed by shelving will take you past displays of dainty chocolates and other temptations.    Turn right at the end of Decadence Alley, and the coffee bar reveals itself - sleek and modern.  I ordered a Guatemalan pour-over, and it was perfect.  The barista politely let me know it would take a few minutes to prepare, and was courteous and pleasant.  She did a great job with the pour-over.  All the subtle notes of the coffee came thru, and the blueberry muffin was an excellent accompaniment, not too sweet, between dry and moist, and dusted with a light sugar/flour thing.    There's additional seating upstairs, and the bathroom downstairs was clean - at the end of the morning rush, or about 9:30am, no mean feat.  (People are just pigs sometimes.  I used to clean the bathrooms when I was a dishwasher in college.  I've SEEN some things that I will never unsee.)  There's a whole bunch of other stuff to buy, in an efficiently used space - a fridge case of cool beverages (get it?), yogurts, and other stuff.  The place isn't a machine, and you could tell that - the staff is working hard and customizing their roles - trading off tasks.  This might slow things down a bit at times, but it didn't when I was there, and makes it seem like a small shop rather than a franchise unit.  Depends what you want.  I'm looking forward to going back.",5.0,2/27/2016,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4.0,"I'm a Star Trek fan so this reference probably will make most sense to geeks out there like me.  In the movie ""Generations"" (the one where they kill off Captain Kirk), the movie starts with the new Enterprise going for a short ride around the solar system to show off to the press.  Then they face a real emergency and half the equipment they need to deal with it isn't onboard yet.  The crew is competent, the ship is a good one, but it was still new and needed some tweaking before it got better.  That's how I feel about my first visit to 2 Beans.  It's definitely got the DNA of a good coffee/chocolate place.  It is an absolutely GORGEOUS space.  I felt like I was walking into some high priced bar or restaurant, not a coffee/chocolate joint.  There is liberal use of elegant looking dark wood shelves, a lot of clear glass in the design and a really nice looking lounge area upstairs.  Near the entrance is a counter seating area that really looks cool enough to be something out of a movie.  The product they stock is attractive (ranging from prepackaged to fresh chocolates) and they use an iPad based system for their registers, which is where I'm convinced things are going more and more in the future.  2 Beans appears to serve ""illy"" brand coffee (if my cup is any indication) which I enjoy.  I had an Americano made and it came piping hot and it was tasty.  Not watered down at all, smooth with nice flavor.  The folks behind the counter were eager to please for sure and drinks were made with good speed.  I'm deliberately front loading all the positive stuff about ""2 Beans"" first because I believe it has great potential to be a cool spot, but there were some glitches which I ascribe to ""first month growing pains"".  First, the layout of the place is really odd.  The area for people to stand on line is really small because a ginormous shelf of packaged goods blocks off some standing room.  If there's only say, 6-7 people on line that's fine.  But if this place takes off, they're going to have lines out the door.  You hang a left when that shelf ends and there's the chocolate bar, but it's practically hidden.  I felt like I had just discovered a secret room in a video game (by the way, the chocolate bar is beautiful, well worth checking out).  Just as you hang that left is a tiny, tiny station for putting sugar (or your preferred substitute) and milk into your drink.  The problem is, there's barely any room to do it.  One guy and I were practically elbowing each other trying to get our coffees taken care of.  Second, the organization needs a bit of work.  I'm very used to my beloved Gregory's Coffee.  You go in, order, the order is yelled out and it's taken care of a few steps down.  Here, the cashier's station wasn't working, so she had to keep running to another station to make change or run cards.  Then while she was gone, one barista was making a drink while another young man was hustling some type of to-go order, leaving me and about three people just standing there a bit befuddled.  Finally my order was taken, and once it was it came out super quick.  Third, there were just a couple weird moments.  First, I took a pic of the chocolate bar and asked when they opened.  The gent there started telling me, and then asked if I worked for a competitor.  Erf?  Then when I asked for a sleeve for my very hot cup, the gentleman behind the counter (different guy) offered me one, but assured me the cup was a ""double layered"" cup that shouldn't need a sleeve, but if needed one I could have one.  I wasn't so much put off by these things as I was confused because I've never encountered them at another coffee shop.  As I said in the beginning of this review, there's great potential here and I'll even go so far as to say I'll give this joint 2.5 stars right off the bat.  I intend to wait a few weeks, let them settle in and then go back for a follow up visit some time.  Fingers crossed as I always like having another elegant choice for coffee in the area!",5.0,12/22/2016,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4.0,"This is located in the middle of 40th and 41st. I can see why people can miss it, since there's no flag or sign outside the entrance and it's part of an office building.  Once you pass the initial threshold, left is the chocolate shop and right is the cafe.  I didnt't purchase any chocolate items, but I did notice the detail and exquisiteness of the individual pieces. They looked like they would be great gifts.  I ordered the Lavender Coffee Latte and a slice of cheesecake. I think the presentation of both were amazing. The latte had a pretty leaf design on top, and the cheesecake was drizzled with caramel and whipped cream on the side. Taste wise.... the latte had a hint of a hint of lavender - the drink itself was light and airy, but I wish I could have tasted more of the lavender. The cheesecake tasted like it was made some time ago - it was very thick. It wasn't dense and rich; the cake had more of a rubbery feeling. There was also no crust to it, no sweet taste, and no flavor.  There is seating upstairs - I like how it overlooks the cafe and the outside but I didn't particular like sitting at one of the two huge rectangular tables, having to share the space with others. It was a bit awkward. There are 3-4 individual sofas and then padded seating lining the other side, but there were no tables, so it was basically just a long seat that none of the customers chose to sit at bc of the lack of a place to put down their coffee.  The servers are friendly, and I'm sure if you work around here, it's a convenient and decent place to go to. Maybe not for someone like me.",4.0,2/25/2017,40.7511373,-73.978866
2Beans,4.0,"Met up with a friend at this semi-hidden place for a cup of coffee and was surprised with what I found inside. The place is split into 2 levels, with a coffee bar, chocolates, and various other treats on the first level, while the second level is a sit down full service section.  Sat upstairs, which was roomier than you would expect for a location so close to grand central. The frappe was good, it was not as sweet as I expected, which is a great thing. There is sugar on the table for those of you who need a bit more sugar rush. Each drink was served on a silver platter with a glass of water and a square of house made dark chocolate. Great touch. The chocolate was 72% cocoa and nicely balanced the coffee.  The only thing I would improve was the service, or waitress was a bit slow and was fairly disinterested in us as customers. Lastly, there are no to-go cups if you decided to sit upstairs. Overall good experience.",4.0,10/17/2014,40.7511373,-73.978866

My macchiato was expertly made and the chocolate sampler was really varied and delicious. My friend's latte was really good as were her petit-fours.  However, it is the the service that keeps this from being a 5 star review.  Although our desserts and coffee came out quickly we were kind of just left be.  Our waitress never asked how everything was, never refilled our water glasses, nothing.  And we had to flag our waitress down at the end to get a check.    All in all, a nice spot to try with delicious coffee, chocolate, and baked goods but probably better suited as a to go option.",5.0,11/1/2015,40.7511373,-73.978866

It is a two leveled store so there is seating upstairs and also downstairs. Downstairs there is seating near the coffee bar and in the back of the shop.

It was a hot day so I got my usual iced coffee and asked what flavors they had. The possibilities were endless and I wanted something outside of my norm french vanilla or hazelnut so I asked for a recommendation. To my surprise ""lavender"" was highly recommended so I went for it. It. Was. Amazing. No need to add sugar - the flavor was just right - it was like a dessert! The menu itself if super cool.

2Beans,4.0,"Coffee combo shop with a step up in presentation.  I needed a place for a quick coffee chat with a friend and 2beans was an option that had nice seating and wasn't your average Starbucks. 2beans fit the bill on Yelp and it sure didn't fail me on the actual day.  Drinks are a little pricier than your average coffee shop but the coffee quality was great. The cappuccino foam was silky soft perfection and so smooth to fold into the coffee. Nothing too extravagant with the latte art, but it had the right balances of creamy, sharp, and aromatic and I didn't need to add anything to it.  Each drink also came with a small packet of dense, cinnamon biscuits. These small niblets packed quite a punch and proved size doesn't matter. They aren't really for dipping but make for something to chew on in between sips. Each tray also came with a glass of water as a palette cleanser, which I thought was pretty classy.  We were able to snag the last open spot in their upstairs seating, so I wouldn't be surprised if it were difficult to find spots during a rush hour. The majority of patrons were also in suits going over documents, so I guess it's a good place to conduct business meetings too?  Either way, it's a nice place for a good cup of coffee if you're willing to shell out a tad more for a nicer presentation.",5.0,5/9/2014,40.7511373,-73.978866
2Beans,4.0,"When I was a kid, I made my first personal email address. Fortunately it wasn't anything super embarrassing, (I'm talking to you, MCRfan93 and JoBros4ever111), it was ""chocolatier"" followed by some numbers. So, my history with chocolate runs long and deep in my soul. Take my words to heart.  This is where you go to get the good stuff.  I was chocolate shopping for the birthday of a venerable old chocolate fan, and I knew I needed some high-quality stuff, but diverse in flavor and locale. Their wall-o-chocolate did not disappoint. It's expensive, but for once I'm not blaming the location - that's the price you pay for some of the best chocolate money can buy. Prepare to drop between $5 and $10 for a bar.  Of course, that's the pre-packaged stuff. Their baked selection is impressive, and their ice cream on the side is a nice touch. As for quality, I cannot yet say - I was feeling pressed for time. Their drink menu is equally impressive and the spicy hot chocolate was positively DIVINE. I'm sorry I had to take it to go - apparently staying with it involves a free bit of chocolate and seating in their gorgeous lounge upstairs.  What really sets this one apart is the staff. When I brought my chocolates to the register, I suppose the cashier noticed that it was quite a lot for one person (I totally could have eaten it all myself though) and asked ""Are any of these going to be gifts?"" She then offered to wrap them, place bows or ribbons - all free of charge. I was stunned. Going the extra mile is something I don't see often, and it's what really inspired me to write this review.  A few final notes; there appears to be a kind of convenience store-ish space in the back. not sure what that's about, but I suppose it sells some items that compliment the chocolate. Yogurt, some juice, etc. It feels a bit out of place, but it must pull its weight or they wouldn't have it. I just wish that area had been used for more chocolate - not that their selection was lacking.  And if you've made it all the way to the end of this review, a bit of advice - check in on Yelp first! There's a good discount to be had! Happy eating.",5.0,7/13/2015,40.7511373,-73.978866

Luckily the staff behind the counter were much friendlier stacking Yelp checkin offer with LevelUp credit (not technically stacking I suppose) (Checkin offer so the specificity of 'off coffee or chocolate' was unnecessary given it's really all they sell, yet they still had to confirm not just coffee despite it stating clearly on the offer)  Transaction Amount $2.76 Credit Applied -- $2.76 Total Spent $0.00  PS their email subscription confirmation comes from rocketandwalker.com and confirming (though it works) brings you to 404 Not Found  The server can not find the requested page:grison.arvixe.com/~twobeans/module/newsletter­page/thanks (port 80) Please forward this error screen to grison.arvixe.com's WebMaster.

2Beans,4.0,"This 2Beans location is pretty popular with the Midtown work crowd, so the coffee must be good. I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't comment on that, but their pastries are pretty good. I gave them three stars because of the odd store lay out and the less then enthusiastic employees. When you walk in the door, you have to past squeeze past everyone already in line to join the queue. Then once you've gotten your food/drink, you have to squeeze past everyone again to get to a station to add sugar, grab a stirrer, etc.",4.0,10/12/2015,40.7511373,-73.978866

You can find chocolates from different countries, get some tasting and discover new brands. I asked for dairy-free chocolates. The lady at the counter gave me samples... ""I like this one, I'll get this"", ""I like that one too, I'll get one of it""... And to realize all of these can be pricey. Oh well, that happened to me on a day when I decided to skip on dessert. And these are quality chocolates made with a few ingredients (Ah, giving myself reasons for not feeling guilty). They also have dairy-free, sugar-free, vegan chocolate. There's a counter with chocolate bonbons sold by the piece, where I saw truffles with shimmer on it. Beautiful and edible. :D",4.0,9/28/2016,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4.0,"My director suggested 2Beans for a place to study as it has a spacious upstairs seating area and strong coffee. I think it's also important to point out the large selection of chocolates you can find at 2Beans.  The level of excitement 2Beans will bring to a chocolate enthusiast is comparable to a child's reaction to FAO Schwarz. The tall walls are stacked with chocolates from various regions and there is always a staff member who is eager to answer any questions. Every time I've wandered in between the chocolate aisles, I've been asked if I had any questions or needed any help finding something in particular. I wanted a nice dark chocolate and was recommended the 88% dark chocolate from Beschle. I also purchased a sea salt and pistachio flavor from the same brand. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate but 2Beans makes me want to try all the exotic flavors they have in stock.  I'm actually a fan of illy espresso so I really enjoyed the strong soy latte I ordered, as well as the free piece of chocolate I got with it. The cups used are also apparently served in compostable cups that look plastic but are actually made from natural sugars? I had no issues with the staff. It did take some time to get my latte and two of the female workers were speaking a lot in spanish..but they got the order out. I also saw someone who appeared to be the store manager overlooking the business.  The upstairs is very spacious with two large communal tables (great for group meetings), comfy couches, small tables, a fireplace, and tvs. There is also an office on the top floor which I found odd and noticed a lot of activity inside. The only con is that all outlets have been blocked off from public use so it is an inconvenience if you are working on a laptop or need to charge your phone (if you're desperate, there's an outlet in the bathroom downstairs, which is kept clean).  Overall, I found 2Beans to be a great spot for business meetings, study groups, catch ups, or even dates. Come by if you're in the Grand Central area!",5.0,2/7/2013,40.7511373,-73.978866
2Beans,4.0,So I really liked this place until today. Let me just say the coffee they have is EXCEPTIONAL so yes I encourage you to go if you want quality coffee beverages but get it to-go!!!! I was with a 2 other people at a table upstairs and my 2 guests had to leave so I stayed to finish my coffee.  Barely 5 minutes had passed and my glass was still not empty and the sever asks me when I'm leaving because people are waiting but oh I'm not trying to rush you out. It's quite obvious I'm not finished and because she and another employee kept staring and eventually walking by I felt clearly unwelcomed so I decided to leave. The worst part was there were other tables open! Not even the slightest mention of this or asking if I wouldn't mind being sat downstairs. So rude and poor service which is disappointing considering how great the coffee is,5.0,3/3/2016,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4.0,"Came here on a Saturday looking for coffee and a space to do work - the place was practically empty when I went, and the seating area upstairs is incredibly comfortable with nice modern decor. I like that Saturdays actually don't have staff service upstairs, so I don't feel rushed or interrupted at all.  Got a strawberry mocha, kinda pricey after tax. It was decent, but I might try something else next time. The coffee bar area looks chic, great for chatting with friends and enjoying the weather. There's also an area for chocolate and random treats & drinks, but I don't care for it.. I feel like it'd be more practical if they turned it into a seating area as well LOL just saying.  This place is almost perfect for what I need, except it closes early on Saturdays and doesn't open on Sundays! :(",3.0,4/18/2015,40.7511373,-73.978866

It's a perfect place to have a work meeting (in their upstairs lounge) or a great place to stop and refuel on your way to the gym!  The staff members were knowledgeable, kind, personable and sweet.

The coffee that i have gotten range from lattes, cappuccino's, and espresso and they have all had great taste and presentation.  I wonder when one will come to my area.

Three stars because now that I see the reviews about the free chocolates if you order to stay, I am disappointed I wasn't even asked if I wanted it to stay (I did!).  Update!  I received a very gracious reply to my review, and they offered me a generous amount of chocolate to make up for the minor oversight!

The coffee is truly perfection in a cup & deserves 5 stars, I'd give ten if I could! It is full of flavor & complexity but still very drinkable. It reminds me of the delicious coffee I had when I was in Italy. I've been drinking coffee for years. Why did it take me so long to find it? Best cappucino in town!

2Beans,4.0,"I went here with my work colleague and her son.  I picked the place, becuase I knew they specialize in chocolate and I was in the mood for hot chocolate.    My colleague ordered cappucino.  Her son and I both ordered hot chocolates.  However, we were told that only ONE of us could have hot chocolate, becuase there is only enough left for ONE serving.  To get more, we would have to wait 15 minutes.  I've never heard of a coffee shop running out of one of their drinks at 1pm.  I didn't feel like waiting 15 minutes for one cup of hot chocolate, so I ordered a Mocha instead.  Similar enough.  My mocha was delicious, if a little small.  They use super-skinny glasses which look impressive but don't fit much actual liquid in them.  The whipped cream on the top was more voluminous than the Mocha liquid.  But it definitely was good.  We enjoyed the upstairs seating area.  Plenty of room for all.  One girl was taking advantage of the space to study from her laptop.  You get a little piece of chocolate with each order, however I didn't eat that as of yet becuase my drink had enough chocolate in it for one day.",5.0,10/14/2013,40.7511373,-73.978866

2Beans,4.0,"This place is pretty good! I got my drink and pastry to stay upstairs. If I hadn't read reviews before I went, I wouldn't have known it was waiter service upstairs. I really would've preferred to grab my drink and food and bring it upstairs myself. There was one waitress for the upstairs area which I guess was fine because it's not that large. They have a nice variation of tables, single comfy chairs, and half booths. I got a hazelnut hot latte with soy milk and a small almost croissant. The latte had a good taste, but it wasn't that hot but that was fine with me. I actually think it was a chocolate latte judging by the taste but that was fine with me bcuz it was good regardless. The croissant was not good. It was very hard and not soft and flaky so I didn't wind up eating a lot of it. I was brought my drink and food along with a small cup of ice water and a piece of dark chocolate which I appreciated. The total for the drink and croissant was around $9.50 (which is not including tip). It was a little expensive but I knew so walking into the place. I may come back again, but possibly get the latte to go since the taste was great. The one thing I thought was odd was that since the wifi was locked, I asked the waitress for the password and she put the password in my phone herself instead of telling me the password.

2Beans,4.0,"ADHD Summary:  A great pit stop when you need a place to sit in style near grand central.  European in style and speed. Great coffee and chocolates.  Speed: I get you came here for caffeine, but one look and you know they are not going to be as fast as the main stream places.  If you're in a hurry, this isn't your place.  If you have a little time or are meeting someone to talk, perfect.  The Coffee: It's good to go. They have soy milk and it isn't Vanilla flavored. I'm happy.  If you order and stay, I love the cups and the way they do the heart shaped topping.  Cafe au lait is very au Lait.  The seasonal coffee specials are quite nice.  The atmosphere: Upstairs has additional seating if you find the bar too cold as the door opens to it and you get a bit more wind than you'd expect in the winter.  It's very trendy.  Even the bathroom is Italian decorated. It is definitely like a bar in here, including the singles scene, though perhaps there is something to be said for a full lighting, sober approach attempt.  The Chocolate:  They definitely do carry some of the more high end brands for chocolate. I was excited as sometimes it's hard to find (Valhora, Charbonnel et Walker).

Kinda difficult to rate this place 5 stars just for not being crappy.  The reward of not being crappy comes in its own form of staying open an extra month or two on Park Ave. where businesses come and go every day.  The sit-down area is definitely a commodity since the Starbucks a couple of yards down the street is always crowded.  The menu item that caught my eye was the Viennese espresso that's supposed to be espresso with melted chocolate and whipped cream. About $4. Been to Austria. Had Viennese espresso.  Sorry guys, not it.  Definitely not worth the $4.  Would have rated this place 3-stars but if you have the balls to open next to a Starbucks, you get an extra star from me.

Rich, flavorful, and not surrounded by hoards of special coffee language speaking drones asking for a ""tall"" anything, you'll find that quality prevails.

2Beans,4.0,This is a very neat place for coffee. The second floor is well decorated and good for a casual business chat or meet up with friends. I actually like that they bring you a small glass of water with a piece of snack from their shop along with your ordered drink. And the snacks vary from time to time.

2Beans,4.0,"2Beanz is one of those places that I want to love & practically try to convince myself it's great. Location wise, this spot is perfect. It's close enough to Grand Central to be a perfect meeting spot and has plenty of seating upstairs. Unfortunately, the actual food and drink offerings are subpar. I've tried a few different things for breakfast and have always felt like their baked goods are stale or come from some factory. The service and presentation is always wonderful (each drink comes with water & a chocolate!), but the drinks themselves aren't particularly good. They do have a lavender latte which is quite interesting, but everything else seems overpriced for what it is. If you need a meeting spot or somewhere to hole up with a laptop for a long time, this place is great, but otherwise I'd recommend something else.",5.0,2/24/2015,40.7511373,-73.978866

When I asked what happened to it I was told they called my name (which is more of a whisper compared to the confident voices at Starbucks), and I didn't come claim it. I guess they made my latte during minute or between signing for my purchase, walking 10 feet to look at the chocolate bar, then coming back. I asked them if they just threw it away, received a puzzled look and was then told they'd make my order again. So they took my order...a few minutes later asked what my order was again, then finally I received my latte. They made it a large for my trouble! ...But used soy instead of milk.

2Beans,4.0,"This is the type of establishment I dream of owning. The staff is sweet and friendly, and the chocolate and coffee are bountiful. The scene is polished, as you'd expect for midtown near GCT, and the prices are pretty high, but, if you can swing it, it is definitely worth it to make a stop. I can't help but order a specialty latte every time I'm there, ringing in at around $6 and change for a 12oz. But why would I get basic coffee from this gorgeous frouffy drink haven? The chocolate selection is to die for. I stopped in and bought 2 chocolates (small pieces, like Godiva individual ones) which rang in at $5.18, holy crap, but they were delicious and worth every penny. (Just can't do it every day.) The upstairs seating area is nice, rather cramped, but that's what you get in Manhattan. All in all I love this place and dream of being rich enough to go here all the time.

The coffee bar is something unique and the upstairs seating area is very comfortable. I like this place a lot, so if you are anywhere near here you should drop by.

2Beans,4.0,"I can't think of anything better than a coffee/espresso and chocolate spot, and let me just say, I would've given it 5 stars; however, it's a little expensive and too modern for my taste. It's sleek ambiance (there's an upstairs area with a fireplace) takes away from the comfort and privacy most people seek in a cafe (however, you do have the option to go upstairs and cozy up next to the fireplace--you got it to them for adding that), and the convenient bar/seating area by the entrance is a nice twist as you take your time to view your choices from the menu, sip, and go. Whatever you desire is going to be delicious. I like this spot because it's convenient to Grand Central and it's so unique to combine 2  awesome treats...coffee and chocolate: Yes, please. Also to note: I gave it a high score because they're not advertising and selling 1 specific brand of chocolate.

The staff runs around with orders, utterly confused and disinterested in their new customers. Granted, it takes time to get in the flow - ..but first impressions are important -- why not make sure everyone was trained and ready to go on Day 1?   To make matters worse, the place is poorly designed, allocating over 50% of their floor space to retail,  and leaving a narrow and confusing flow pattern for those ordering coffee.  In fact, the chocolate bar within the store was closed this morning, so why the inefficient use of space? Why not combine the areas and make them multi-functional?   In any event, ordering coffee this morning, one queues up behind one of two checkouts, with no clear indication of a line.  Ordering is done through those annoying IPADs, which make little sense for high volume checkouts, especially when the customer has to sign on the screen for ordering a $3 coffee.  Where else do you have to sign for a $3 credit card charge? Certainly not at Starbucks down the street.  I'm hoping this place will get better, as it's convenient and the coffee is genuinely OK.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"I think this place was originally just a florist but loved their creativity in making it dual purpose and establishing a cafe within the same space. The air quality in here is super crisp and refreshing thanks to all the lush, happy, healthy plants filling the shop (seriously, the difference is instantaneous one you get out of the dirty city air outside).  Since the space is only small (10-12 people), you won't be getting a large group in here, nor is it child friendly (too many things for them to touch and break). It is a great space to work away on your laptop though which is what half the people in here were doing. There is a restroom too, very beautifully decorated with plants (I kinda just wanted to stay in there, it was so nice...minus the florist materials they also stored in there haha xD).  There isn't a great deal of food or snack items but they do have some lovely Madeleine cookie cake thingies as well as some delicious mini friands (I bought a bag of matcha ones, just trust me and do it, you can thank me later!). There was a decent variety in drinks both hot and cold at average cost of $5-6 dollars. I ordered the iced matcha latte (with skim milk) and my husband got an iced lavender latte. My matcha latte was very generic but my husband's lavender latte (with skim milk) was quite nice, they actually used dried lavender petals and the coffee beans used taste superior to the general population of coffee houses. I saw them using glass flasks and spirally tubes to procure the coffee brew, respect to old school methods like that :D .....I think I might've made the barista uncomfortable with the intensity of my fascination, I do that sometimes haha xD  I haven't come across anything like this in NYC, only in Asia, so save yourself the plane ticket and check out this beautiful cafe!!!

On the other hand, the lattes and the art atop them were just lovely. I'd also be willing to rank this place in the 95th percentile in terms of variety of milk alternatives (who knew macadamias had nipples?!?)

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,A flower shop and a coffee shop! The space is so small with about 6 small round tables that seat 2 people. The place has flowers everywhere! I really like the idea that I can buy flowers from here. I'm not sure what the pricing is on it so I'll update my review if I get something.  What I enjoyed was their lavender latte! They have a to stay option where they give you a mug but I got mine to go. The lavender latte was so yummy! And the latte art was so carefully done. This is a great location if you wanted to do a coffee date with a friend. I can't wait to try their rose latte next!  The wait time took a while when I came because it was only 1 person behind the counter taking orders and crafting the drinks but as soon as there was a line forming there was another barista who came to help. I can't wait until summer for their ice latte creations as well!,5.0,1/31/2019,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"It's a cute little place with some unique Tea and Coffee flavors. Went there for my morning coffee and the placed just wowed us. All tables have beautiful fresh flowers arranged and provide just an amazing vibe to the place. You will find people taking a lot of pictures and Instagrammers doing their thing so sometimes it gets hard to find a table.  The coffees and teas are little expensive in comparison to your regular deli. Also, the flavored coffees and teas are little on a sweater and flowery side as expected. A lot of drinks have dried rose petals and other flowers parts.  I will definitely recommend everyone to give it a try.",5.0,1/23/2019,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"Super cute coffee shop in the middle of a bustling city. The flowers make it seem like you are are taking a break from the fast paced life outside. I ordered the lavender latte, and it was delish. What doesn't give it the perfect rating is that they have limited pastries (including no gluten free options) and limited space. Granted, everywhere in NY has limited space, the flowers took up a lot of space that could have squeezed in at least one other table!",4.0,3/6/2019,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

It's a standout of a cafe, for both its coffee and its gorgeous ambiance. Stop in, take a break, relax, enjoy one of their unique lattes, and feast your eyes on their flowers and even their lime tree.  If there is a downside, it'd be that the price is pretty high for black coffee and lattes, but inflation is a bitch and rose petals come at a price.",5.0,12/7/2018,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"I came here because my friend who knows I love Instagram, coffee, and flowers recommended this establishment. I'm so glad I came because I was not disappointed!  Remi's Flower and Coffee is a smaller coffee shop that has more flowers than it does tables to sit at. But, the coffee is delicious and so creatively made.  I'm not a very big fan of lavender so I ordered the rose latte with almond milk. The owner/my server was very nice and fast with my order. The rose latte was gorgeous and a decent size cup for coffee!  If you want to duck away from the concrete jungle for a few minutes and sip coffee with friends or just on your own- Remi's Flower & Coffee is the place for you.",5.0,11/30/2018,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"I've passed this place so many times and I always admire how beautiful it is. At first I thought it was only a flower shop and I didn't realize they sell coffee. I'm so glad I finally paid this place a visit!  The inside is so beautiful. It feels comfortable, calming, relaxing, and inviting. It's really enjoyable to look around at all of the plants while relaxing and enjoying your drink. My only complaint is that it's a small place and I've never found an open seat and been able to really sit inside comfortably.  The drinks match the flower shop theme. There are a lot of floral lattes that are beautifully adorned with flowers on top. I don't like milk and wasn't in a coffee mood so I got one of their tea specials, a grapefruit honey tea. I didn't really enjoy it that much. It really just tasted like warm grapefruit juice. It was $5 plus tax which felt expensive for what I got.  I would come back here again and try another drink. My recommendation would be to get here early to get a spot to actually sit inside and relax.",3.0,12/3/2018,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"Both a cafe and florist shop, expect a crowd when going to Remi's. Came here with a small group on the weekend and it was packed! Although they do have a decent amount of seating our group of four was out of luck and had to stand. For the price, everyone agreed that the size of their drinks was too small, and flavor wise my chai was just ok. The rose latte seems quite popular here due to the bright red color is has (very instagramable). Unfortunately, they only had one person working the cafe section of the store, so it took forever for us to get our drinks. I honestly think the florist side of this business is better, they had lots of beautiful and unusual flower arrangements as well as high quality and decently priced for Manhattan potted plants. I'd probably come here for the flowers, not the cafe in the future. (FYI this is not a place to come and study or work on a computer.)",3.0,3/13/2019,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

They have oat milk as an option, so that's a great advantage.  My matcha tasted great - creamy but light, not overpowering or watered-down. While the rose latte looked amazing, with real petals on top, we found it to be overwhelmingly sweet.

When it comes to places like this, I was incredibly skeptical that the coffee would not taste as good as the shop looks. However, I can't even complain about that because my lavender and rose lattes were amazing. The floral fragrances were not strong with the coffee; instead, it added a slight freshness every time you took a sip of your coffee.

The spot was pretty quiet so they didn't have to worry about a large rush of customers, since it was early in the morning.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"My experience here can be summed up in one word: repulsive.  Waited at the counter and placed an order for 2 lavender lattes, one iced and one warm. We ordered them ""to stay"" because we wanted to enjoy them in the coffee shop.  The place was crowded but we managed to get a seat at a small table for 2. The barista called our name to let us know the drinks were ready. The iced lavender latte was great tasting, great flavor, just the right amount of milk, ice, flavor, espresso. It came in a disposable plastic cup.    The warm lavender latte was served in a ceramic mug and it had someone's lipstick all over it. It was a dirty used mug that had been drank by the previous customer and never had been washed, it had only been refilled with another latte. We complained to the girl who took our order. She didn't apologize and said you'll have to be patient and wait for another latte.  We waited for the second latte, and the 2nd mug looked like it was dirty as well. The saucer had water on it and some other debris and it looked like the saucer and mug had not been cleaned. How could you do something so egregious twice?!  And to the same customer!?  I would NEVER return here. I prefer clean mugs when I drink my coffee or latte.  It appears that when they're busy, they take the used mugs and place them in one sink and the ones that are supposed to be cleaned are in the same sink--and they have a small divider between them. This is apparently something that's confusing for the barista who reaches into the dirty side of the sink and prepares lattes in dirty unwashed mugs.

We got the lavender latte and berry rose milk tea, which were both yummy. I liked the berry rose latte a little more, even though it was essentially rose flavored warm milk. If you like the taste of lavender, the lavender latte is VERY strongly lavender and has more of a coffee aftertaste to it. The flowers in the shop are beautiful, people are really friendly and less touristy, more local neighborhood stop-by-for-our-morning-joe kind of people, and as a plus their drip coffee is only $1 if you check in on yelp.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"I'm always surprised when I can grab a seat, considering this coffee shop only has a handful of tables. The popularity of this shop makes sense - the dual use of the space adds to the aesthetics of the coffee shop, and you'll find many people taking photos of their latte art before finally enjoying their drinks. If you're a black coffee drinker, I'd strongly recommend their Americano over drip coffee. Even considering the Yelp check in deal.  Service is hit or miss. The first time I visited, more than half of the people in line literally left without ordering because the line wasn't moving at all. There was only one person at the counter, and she ignored everyone in line while making drinks. While waiting isn't a big deal, a quick acknowledgement or ""we'll take your order asap"" would have been nice. That said, I'm pretty sure this was an anomaly, however, as about 10 minutes later a girl came running in and took her place behind the register.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"This place really frustrates me because I so desperately want to give them five stars. It should have hit all the marks: the space is bright and beautiful, and doesn't feel overwhelming despite the countless number of plants in the store; there are a good number of seats for the small space along with free wifi; the food and drinks menu looks good with your standard coffee and expresso-based offerings, pastries, and also very interesting teas (yuzu and jujube in particular stood out to me). It is a family-run business and I am a big proponent of these small coffee shops popping up in boring old Midtown.  But the espressos...are not good. I got the flat white and my boyfriend got the cortado. The burnt and acrid taste of the overly extract expresso cut straight through the milk and they were not the smooth drinks I expected at all. That's really frustrating because I can't, in good conscience, overlook it since Pennylane is only a couple of blocks away and pulls a much smoother shot. I really hope this is an issue with the beans / the new machine still needs some flushing out or adjustments for the right water to ground ratio. Probably will be sticking to the teas here until that's corrected. On the bright side, they have oat milk as an dairy alternative and that's an exciting new product I'm hoping more places will start carrying (as far as I know, Irving Farm in Midtown is the only other place that carries it right now).  Nevertheless, I'm pumped to see this place opened in my neighborhood and have my eyes on some of the cute poinsettias for holiday decorating!",4.0,11/25/2017,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

It's a flower shop / coffee shop and the plants in there are simply beautiful. Their drinks are just as beautiful and tasty as well! I got the lavender latte and my sister got the rose berry cold drink, and both were amazing. The presentation was on point and the flavor was just perfect.

It's a quaint little cafe that feels like a indoor garden with many different types of plants, not just flowers. Seating is minimal but sitting on the long table with a cup of berry-yuzu ade was very refreshing. I wouldn't say it's the best cafe nor the best florist shop but the synergy between the two is definitely worth dropping by. It's a beautiful little oasis in the hectic streets of upper east side.",5.0,10/9/2018,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

However, there are not a lot of sitting space and we were waiting for seat and when we asked the worker to clear up the table from the previous customers, he did do it.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"Stopped by here as I've been in search of some special succulents, but found myself pleasantly surprised by everything else as well. The shop has an immediate cozy feeling, and had many other plants and flowers which caught my eye as well. I also ended up trying the Yuzu iced tea which was a perfect amount of sweet to still allow the Yuzu juice to shine through, and ultimately made for an extremely refreshing drink on such a warm day.  Overall, would highly recommend this place whether you're looking for some new decor for your house, or if you're looking for a cool place to hang out and grab a quick drink",4.0,9/4/2018,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"Such a cute space!! Picture worthy? Very much so. They use La Colombe coffee (one of my top faves!). My cappuccino was just right with that strong espresso taste I like rather than something that tastes milked down. They also have a selection of pastries to choose from. They have one larger communal table (maybe could fit 4-6 if you really squeeze) and two smaller tables for maybe 2-3 people catching up with conversation. They have free WiFi as well so it made it a nice place to study. Their plants add a lot of life to the shop. Several people came in not for the coffee but to purchase some flowers and plants. They seem a bit pricey for me, but then again, I haven't really shopped around for plants in NYC so maybe the prices are normal?? I'm not often on the east side but I would definitely come back!",5.0,2/9/2018,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"Fantastic addition to the neighborhood! My husband and I live around the corner, and we've made Remi our go-to for pre-work coffee and housewarming presents.  Coffee: they serve La Colombe. I don't drink coffee but the hubby is a fan of their espresso and drip coffee. Their earl grey lattes are worth a try too! We normally grab and go but there are a handful of tables if you want to enjoy the greenhouse-esque sanctuary.  Flowers: their succulents and cacti are especially delightful. And if you can afford it, their little trees are sublime! The staff wrap everything you buy with such delicate care. It feels like a true mom-and-pop place; they really put their hearts into everything!",2.0,1/3/2018,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

And what's better than sitting among beautiful flowers on a sunny afternoon, it's hard to find in New York City! Their flowers are very beautiful and have interesting design too! The florists seem to be very talented and attentive. A big plus is that I get to enjoy my coffee while my 10 months old get mesmerized by the beautiful vibrant colors and the magic like movement of coffee making.

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"This place is really cute with the flower wall and all the decors but I ordered one of their summer special drinks and I didn't really enjoy it. It was this sparkling strawberry rose drink I forgot the name of it, it was a 16oz drink for $6. That's totally not worth my money because the drink wasn't even good. It's so artificial, it's basically sparkling water with a few rosebuds, a slice of strawberry, and some strawberry syrup. I literally could have gone 7/11 and bought a bottle of sparkling strawberry water for $2. I would still go back to try their other drinks but I know for sure I'm not going to order that drink again. Also, don't take their paper straws because they will charge you 25 cents for it. I didn't know so I took one and I think they thought that I was trying to steal a paper straw... It's literally only 25 cents, it's not like I can't afford it, I ordered your $6 drink already. What kind of damage can 25 cents do to me?",5.0,9/18/2018,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,A beautiful space and very pretty latte art. I feel I have to write because as a buyer beware. I came in specifically to buy flowers because it's so hard to find florists with this kind of gorgeous atheistic. I worked with the florist to create a bouquet. Most florists will ask how much you are looking to spend before they create the bouquet. She did not. the bouquet we created amounted to three ranunculus and three roses with some seeded eucalyptus.  At the most it should have cost 40 dollars. The girl who made the bouquet said something to the girl at the register and the register girl looked at her very surprised and they laughed and then charged me 78 dollars!

Originally just stopped in to get some coffee but decided to get a bouquet for my apartment since they were too beautiful to pass up. Both the florist and barista were super helpful. Decided on a chai latte which was delicious. Glad I finally found a coffee shop so close to my office!,5.0,11/22/2017,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062
Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,Best coffee place around this area. The barista was legit cuz he used a scale when he made coffee. (I don't drink coffee when baristas don't measure the weight of espresso even if they use an automatic grinder.) I had double espresso and cortado. They were smooth and good. I will definitely go to this place again for coffee.,5.0,11/25/2017,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"I feel so guilty for not writing a five star review! Remi was a last minute stop to satiate a desperate need for coffee, and it was far from anything less than satisfactory. The shop itself was super humid, but that was just the Manhattan weather at the time. The flowers were beautiful and there were quite a few guests drinking coffee in the shop, but I found that the shop itself was overcrowded and we had to wait behind some flowers to avoid bursting other customers' personal bubbles. I took advantage of the $1 drip coffee offer while my brother got the cortado. The latte art was exquisite, but I felt that I got judged for being in the dark (I was visiting NY for the first time and the policies were definitely not what I was expecting). Other than that, the coffee was satisfactory. I feel that the east coast probably prefers less sweetened coffee than the west overall, because my coffee only came with milk and I didn't see any sugar nearby. However, Remi would still be a ""would recommend"" as a coffee place for me, especially with their $1 coffee deal.",5.0,9/5/2018,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

Remi Flower & Coffee,4.5,"Overall bad experience. Went in one morning for a coffee and it took two bored baristas a whole five minutes to get me a simple coffee which was overpriced, I mean it was le Colombe coffee, it shouldn't be over $3 for a small.  The barista (who was quite rude, not smart as I was the only customer) filled my cup a little over 2/3 even after I said ""no room for milk"" and she nodded, clearly hearing me.  The concept is an ok idea, but it's too bright inside and not a typical warm, inviting cafe. It feels more like a convenience store with the bright lights and smell - not of coffee or food, but of musty plants. Also, the seating was strange, an ill conceived plan that is again, not inviting at all. I only went in because I liked the idea of flowers and coffee and wanted to support a new business, but nothing about the place made me want to return. I'm sure it will survive, however, people like paying too much for middling food and bad service.",4.0,12/13/2017,40.70544486444615,-73.99429321289062

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,Cute and hip little coffee shop in the basement of a semi-busy street near Times Square. I usually avoid the area around Times Square like the plague but happened to stumble upon this spot one day and had to go inside. It gave off major Williamsburg vibes and wasn't too crowded. Think white and black interior with a cute Instagrammable neon sign and some plants.  Coffee was reasonably priced ($2.75 for a small 8oz) and they didn't charge extra for almond milk. Quality coffee and not bitter at all. I got my coffee to go but there was plenty of seating inside and WiFi. Would definitely come back to do work here.,5.0,2/24/2019,40.7588772,-73.9902301

The cappuccino was okay..I did really like that they had a variety of milk options. I got mine with almond milk. Other than that though this was a bit forgettable.  Croissant was pretty good, nicely sized and light and flaky.  It's a smaller shop with about seating for 14+. Modern minimalist design.  It was quiet when I came in with more people grabbing their coffee to go. Price was about what you would expect for a cafe near Times Square.",3.0,11/29/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301

Located in the basement of a tenement building, the cafe has a small number of tables and free wifi, and pastries from various local bakeries, including cookies from Ovenly, and donuts from Underwest (only on Wednesdays and Saturdays last time I checked).

Worried about being let down by midtown coffee not living up to Australian standards, I went with a tea, which they have many flavors of. Jasmine tea was strong and refreshing, enough flavor for two cups. They also have pastries and bars. Music is pretty loud, but there are people working on their laptops here. Service is cool.

We were the first in, and really got to enjoy the coffee shop for what it was. It's a cute shop on the lower level and has a lot of great coffee and pastry options. I had the pistachio cardamom bread with a flat white, and it was delightful. My cousins were impressed with the s'mores donut (he said it's more of a cake donut, but still delicious), and the fall-inspired latte art on the Mocha.  The two baristas were really kind and made sure we felt comfortable. we enjoyed the music they had on, and overall, the atmosphere of the coffee shop. It's a nice place to sit in the morning if you're early enough to beat the crowds. Typical prices you'd expect for a NYC coffee shop.",5.0,10/7/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301

The interior has a modern and natural design that makes you feel like you've been transported to the sub urban wilderness. Also, since it's located in the basement, a lot of the street noise is muffled.  The staff was super friendly. Unlike the usual monotone and uninterested staff who repeat like a broken record ""May I take your order? ...all our drinks are good"", the staff here was full of energy and had a great attitude when recommending me some drinks.  I ordered an iced coffee with soy milk for $4. It wasn't the best but it was pretty decent. However, $4 for a small cup of coffee is quite expensive.

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Cute coffee shop in Hell's Kitchen area located on 44th street on the lower level off the street. There's a decent amount of seating given the store size- probably seats 15-16 people. Didn't see a bathroom though.  Very friendly baristas and service. They have your typical espresso menu and also have drip coffee and cold brew. They have this Kyoto cold brew which is supposed to stronger than regular cold brew. They carry almond, soy and oatly oat milk.  I sat to read for a little over an hour- with ear phones it's pretty good. Without ear phones it's not that quiet. But they play typical coffee house chill music otherwise. It's a little dim for studying I feel.  The decor is more on the edgy hipster side- mostly black and white decor. Not your typical brightly lit/ girly kinda coffee shop. They have a cute neon sign for that says ""damn fine coffee"" which is their slogan I think.  Overall I like this coffee spot!

I got the house drip black, but if you want milk, you have your regular dairy choices plus oat milk, soy, and almond.  I think they have rice but don't remember for sure.  The coffee was perfectly temped at a delicate, yet, warming degree, and it was perfection while I waited to get seated.  After brunch, brought some friends along who also got their caffeine fix.  The space is tiny so definitely better for a grab and go, but they have a nice nook outside that has a bench if you want to nestle yourself in while sipping a soothing cup of finely-roasted and crafted caffeinated brew.",5.0,10/3/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"I can't stop coming here! Love the location, the shop, the barista, and most importantly the coffee/espresso!!  I love coming here before heading into work, it feel like such a respite from the commotion of 8th Ave. The decor is clean and and low-key, giving it a very nice atmosphere. It's very well lit for being a ""below the street"" place, and I honestly think that adds to it's charm, you get a visual break form the city too. They have a good amount of seating, and I've always been able to snag a seat if I wanted one.  Prices are reasonable, if not a bit lower than the typical NYC cafe. It seems like they have a lot of regulars too, the barista seemed to a lot of people who came in. She was really lovely.  They make such a good latte! The espresso is always perfect, and I don't even add sweetener when I get their latte. The cold brew is also on point, full bodied and not bitter at all. Mmm! They have a good assortment of baked goods too, the chocolate chip cookie has a dash of sea salt which always brings the flavors up a level.  Do yourself a favor and stop by, this place is a gem!",5.0,7/29/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Looking for a taste of home whilst visiting NYC. there's something to be said for ordering a coffe and it is the perfect, single cup size, not a big gulp of brown water. I learned they don't serve soy and hot hemp. Perfect. Would be nice if it had more Aussie vibes, and the barista mixed the sugar into the brew. The hipsters serving were a bit too stand offish and perhaps don't get too many Aussies coming in who need to ask how to order. That ticked me off a bit because my expectations were a bit high given the name. However the coffee is damn good!  I'll be back!",4.0,2/5/2019,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Scotland, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand all have areas of land called ""Saint Kilda"" and, honestly, I wish this coffee shop had a similar number of locations because it is siiiiiiick.  I used to live kind of close to this place and I am sad it didn't exist when I did. This is a really beautiful cafe with a crazy selection of treats from places like Ovenly and Underwest Donuts.  The monster star here is the oat milk and the espresso though. They combine to make a drink unlike anything I have ever seen before with these black flecks and deep ochre crema (see pics).

I came here for a coffee and time to sit and read by myself while waiting for a friend. Fair warning, this place doesn't have many seats, and also doesn't have any bathrooms. The staff was nice enough to tell me where I could get a free (and nice bathroom) at a nearby hotel, and I told them to go ahead and make my latte, I would be right back. They had my coffee ready for me by the time I got back, and I had also ordered a doughnut, and that was plated for me to grab, as well. The staff is very friendly, and patient, as I took my time asking about which doughnut I might order. The music is quiet in the background, and the tables are clean, but small.

You have to go down a little set of stairs to enter, but it's surprisingly big inside with a good amount of indoor seating. It also has s few benches outside for seating as well. I only got tea, but the tea list is nice with a variety of options, all certified organic. The man working behind the desk was also very warm and welcoming.  Next time I'd like to try some coffee.

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"The general rule in NYC is the further away from Times Square you go, the better the coffee becomes. St. Kilda Coffee is the exception. On 44th St in between 9th and 10th Avenues, it's 1.5 blocks from Times Square (aka the tourist trap). As any good coffee shop should that close to Times Square, it's hidden in the basement of a building and very easy to miss. But don't. It's worth not missing.  It's a small espresso shop with two small tables at the window, four small tables to the right, and a medium sized table to the left when you walk in. The bar is at the back crafting a great cup of espresso or latte. Pastries are served all day and the corn flake blueberry muffin is one of the best muffins in NYC. Just outside the basement are a few black benches to enjoy the outside with your cup of coffee.  Surprisingly, it's a cozy place to work. Most people get their coffee to go so you're bound to find an open table. With plenty of outlets throughout the shop an strong free WIFI ( network name is ""Cafedownunder"" and password is ""findusonyelp"" as of April 30, 2018), it's a great spot to work.  Another thing to note is the barista is friendly. NYC AND coffee shops get a bad rap on friendliness so that says something! A NYC barista nice? AWESOME!",5.0,4/30/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301

Pros: free wifi, available seating (including some benches outside), music is not too loud, many available outlets Cons: uncomfortable seating (tables are too low and small, the walls are lined with a wire thing that connects the outlets, so if you sat at the tables you will find that leaning against the wall is very uncomfortable), no bathroom, poorly lit, meh prices (paid 2.50 for a small coffee that is about 3/4 of a typical small coffee size).",4.0,9/27/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301

From the friendly barista to the cool vibe to the extensive menu (with all your third wave pour over stuff) - everything's great...except the coffee itself. I mostly get espresso based drinks here (cortado, cappuccino) and they always taste bland and lifeless. Whatever beans they use for espresso are pretty one-dimensional and lean toward bitter. I can't taste the sweetness or much acidity in them.  On top of that, I don't know what kind of milk they use (I always ask for regular whole milk) but it just tastes bland. No creamy taste whatsoever.  I'm gonna keep trying other things at this coffee shop to see if they are any better but espresso/milk based drinks are just not up to par.",5.0,8/29/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301

I also ordered a Whole Wheat Banana Bread slice to try (figured it would be good practice in starting off my healthy lifestyle resolution before the new year) and I am honored to say, it tasted marvelous! I'm quite a big fan of this place.  Reason why I didn't give it a full 5-stars is because each time I come here, the staff makes me feel like I've just upset them with my arrival or perhaps New York in general has jaded them. (I've also only been here 2x in my life, so I'm positive I didn't offend anyone during my visits).  As a solution, I hope all the people who do visit this place greets the staff with a smile and more courtesy. They bring so much joy to the hearts of disgruntled New Yorkers, I think it's worth giving them back the same level of respect and love (at the very least a smile to make them feel better about their days too).",5.0,6/12/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301

Unfortunately, despite all the style I'm not crazy about the coffee here, well espresso for me that is.  By far my biggest peeve - they won't take my loyalty card and my CUPS app at the same time?!?  Not cool.  :-( You want me to choose? Then you'll lose every time because I love my Cups app and I use it everywhere.  But I'll let you in on a little secret - I never finish my loyalty cards!!! Well, except the coffee shop right downstairs at work because well, everybody's lazy.  So I every year I have to purge my wallet of about 20 loyalty cards with like max 2-3 punches each.  So dammit, why you gotta ruin my fun?  I just like collecting them. :-(  Always seem to snag a table here, so that's nice.  I like the little black wooden spoon they always give me with my espresso.  Oh, and if you're lucky they're brewing the super long Japanese cold brew in the big circular tube drip apparatus.  Oh, and what's up with the decaf espresso?  I wish people would just be honest and say no sometimes but they never do.  Then I'd just order tea or nothing.  I asked and the guy said yes.  You know, the usual nonchalant hipster I don't care type answer.  I asked where because I only saw one grinder and he vaguely gestured somewhere else so I just gave up.  Sorry, I guess decaf ain't cool?  Every coffee shop has regular/skim/almond/soy/etc. milk now but decaf still has a shame thing going on.  Well I started drinking decaf recently for health reasons (none of your damn business thanks) but my hubby still drinks regular.

Simple interior to go along with a straight forward menu. Settled on the regular latte and a cheddar scone (total $8). Latte has the right amount of milk that balanced out the bitter coffee. Not overbearing at all but kept me awake for most of the day. Scone is your regular fare, a little tough on the outside but a soft buttery interior.  This place is adept for people who want to work on their laptops. Outlets all along the walls near the tables.

I almost felt like I was somewhere tropical with the plants dotting the staircase one descends to enter the cafe.  There's room for about 20 people to sit  - individual people and a group were working away. Also, It didn't hurt that the Clash was on....

I ordered a mocha which was perfect because most places make it too sweet but this had more of a subtle bitter chocolate taste. There's a tiny food selection, but gluten free cakes, scones and cookies  The staff is friendly and there's a book exchange if you're in need of a new read. It's a very mellow place, they were playing the new Radiohead album, perfect cafe to do work. There's plenty of sockets and free wifi adorably named ""cafedownunder"". It's definitely worth stopping by.",4.0,3/18/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Cute. Instagram-able. Mildly festive around holidays. (See: they did put up cobwebs with plastic spiders for Halloween, but it's not like they put a gourd on every table -- ya dig?)  If you're a fan of working in cleanly designed, minimalist spaces -- then this spot will suit your vibe. They play chill, mostly lyric-less tunes -- like Ratatat.  It's the perfect escape from Time Square. Four stars because there's no bathroom. A coffeeshop without a bathroom is an urban nightmare.",4.0,10/23/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"BEST COFFEE in Midtown maybe in Manhattan.  It was my second time visiting Manhattan and I've tried more than 10 local coffee shops that have good ratings on Yelp. This one definitely stands out by a long shot. During my 3 weeks stay, I visited this place almost everyday and the staff were super friendly, always open to chat and remembered my usual order. They use SEY Coffee and I even bought some beans home.  They have free wifi. Don't forget to ask for a punch card!",5.0,7/5/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Yelped up this coffee shop cause a friend and I were meeting and needed to be near a certain location. I usually disregard good ratings that haven't established a large enough mass, but given St Kilda is fairly new and I needed a place to sit, we decided to come here. I decided to stick around after our meet up and ended up staying for hours!  The space is bright with gorgeous white walls, the vibe of customers in this part of midtown is energizing, the coffee is clearly thoughtfully made and tastes great. The variety on the menu is great and the variety of the customers is so interesting too. A lot of people come in and out so there is almost always at least one empty table that can seat 2.  I saw one barista take on a sudden spurt of customers with absolute calmness, quickness, and with a friendly manner! Really impressed by this new establishment. Wishing the best to the owner!",5.0,3/20/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Places like this always have the small cups and high prices for what I'm used to, but the Americano I had was fantastic and the latte my wife had was really good she said.

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,The iced dirty chai here is off the hook!!!! Love that they brew birch coffee here too.  Staff are super friendly and it's a nice escape of the hustle and bustle outside.  Huge plus that it's a CUPS app place.,4.0,1/6/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Ordered the cold brew which was really delicious. It's a small shop but they kept the long line fast moving so it wasn't overcrowded. The employees were super nice as well. It's a great work space because there are a bunch of outlets with strong WiFi.  My only compliant is it was a hot summer day when I came in, and the only ventilation they had was keeping the front door open. It got a bit stuffy/hot in there, especially since it's a basement location. Probably best to order to go, but overall, I would come back and stay to sit down.",5.0,10/24/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"In a very few years, NYC has become a worthy great-coffee destination. The bar for high-quality java is high, indeed.  St. Kilda is on the border between the theater district and Hell's Kitchen: it's across the street from Birdland. Though it's at the basement level, it's all glass facing the street. Plenty of light reflected off the white walls.  There are a few tables. Their equipment is top quality. Coffee by Birch--it is excellent. I got a latte, and it was one of those. One of those where I left, had my first sip, and had to return and thank them: it was a God shot. Flawless foam (meaning, not boiling hot). Excellent job combining milk and the shot. No fussy latte art, but you know, I've lost count of the hearts and birds and what not where the coffee drink tasted like utter hell.  Welcome to the neighborhood. Locals, support this place; they deserve it.",5.0,1/12/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"My Australian friend told me about this place and he was happy to see an Australian coffee shop opened in the area. I came here at 8:45am on a Thursday morning and there was no line and a few seats left. I got a small coffee with milk and an almond croissant by Balthazar Bakery totaling $6.35. Both tasted amazing! I'm not a huge coffee drinker but their coffee is much better than a lot of coffee I've had. There were many people in and out, but still quiet and relaxing for a coffee shop near Times Square. The baristas are also very friendly and welcoming!",5.0,8/24/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"I like to find new coffee shops to try out on trips. Being in Times Square, I didn't think I would find a small business owned coffee shop, but happily ran into St. Kilda Coffee!  This is my type of coffee shop.  Good music, seating for reading, writing Yelp reviews, or any lounging you want to do. The mocha I ordered is pretty darn tasty, too. It's a find! Check it out!",5.0,9/27/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"I love the location of this new coffee shop. Although it borders on two busy neighbourhoods, the Theatre District and Hell's Kitchen, it's like a hidden gem and feels like your own private coffee shop. It's right across the street from Birdland so be sure not to miss it since it's in the basement.  The staff is very friendly and love chatting with the customers. It definitely has a charming and welcoming atmosphere which is usually a criteria for me when assessing coffeeshops. There are a few tables as the place is quite small, but that is what makes it feel intimate and a great work space since there isn't too much distraction.  I got the cappuccino and really enjoyed it.  I love that it's a locally owned coffee shop which makes the experience more unique and it's always a pleasure supporting places like this.",5.0,2/5/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"Cozy spot in theatre district. It's hard to find quiet oasis like here in this part of Manhattan.  I had an espresso and vegan chocolate muffin. Espresso was strong and flavorful.  Vegan muffins tend to be hard, but this one was delicious. It was soft with lots of chocolate.  If espresso was served with seltzer, 5 stars.  Don't get me wrong though. Service here is friendly and good.",4.0,7/27/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301
St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"I come in often for coffee here. Except for how pricey they are coffee is good and the breakfast items (croissant, scone, donuts on wed) are decent and from well-known places. Only thing I do not like about this place is the fact that you order a large iced latte and they say it is extra to request extra shot or something along the line.. I don't exactly remember but something along that line. Will ask next time and correct my review if necessary!",4.0,3/22/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"I love this coffee place. It's super convenient for me to go to in the mornings. Their chai lattes are to die for. It's a bit expensive so that stops me from going in everyday, but it's worth it when I do because they give you a little punch card for every visit and you can redeem a coffee after 10 punches. I wish they had matcha tea, and also more bakery treats or something more breakfast-y to accompany my coffee. Get an almond croissant though. Do it.",5.0,9/20/2018,40.7588772,-73.9902301

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,"A Writer's Coffee Shop Review: St Kilda Coffee  St Kilda hasn't been open long, 4 months or so, but I'm always on the hunt for a coffee shop that I can actually write in. You know the kind? Not library quiet but not Starbucks loud. Not deserted and lonely, but not strangers reading your laptop screen. You know, the goldilocks zone. For me, St Kilda's ""is just right.""  This place gets an A+ from me. You can do some serious editing here, and notebook or laptop first drafts. It's not so loud you can't think, and it's not so quiet all you do is think about how you're not writing enough. And, at least while I was there, there was some great people watching, giving you a good chance at some character inspiration.

I had some time to kill while waiting for a friend and this was ideal. There are several tables and a small counter area facing the street. They have a full coffee menu (any drink can be made iced) but limited baked goods which should be expanded to compete with the better known coffee shops. There is a selection of books if you need something to read as well as T-shirts and small bags for purchase with logos. They can provide you with a card that after so many purchases you get a free cup (9). The staff is friendly and accommodating and it was busy when I was there.

St Kilda Coffee,4.5,Best coffee in Hell's Kitchen.  I get my morning coffee here every single day ever since I moved into the neighborhood.  The cold brew is really smooth (not acidic like at chain coffee spots) and the hot coffee is also the best around.  This place is for coffee lovers but is not pretentious at all -- the vibe is totally chill and the staff are really friendly.  I'll be going here every day for coffee (and their pastries are good too -- I recommend the almond croissant).,5.0,9/1/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301

I would highly recommend this. Warning: if you like sweet drinks this may not be for you, I heard the barista tell the customer after me that they only had mocha syrup and not other flavors. On the flip side, this shows you how confident they are in their coffee! It really doesn't need syrup!",4.0,12/29/2017,40.7588772,-73.9902301

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"My first time here and it was great but at the same time bit scary of a experience! Allow me to explain:  The good: the coffees are decent, very friendly baristas, sufficient seating upstairs and a bathroom well taken care of. Fast WiFi, some power outlets upstairs and they don't bother you like other places if you're just working on your computer with a coffee.  Now the scary part--which was completely my fault. I was locked inside!  It's one of those afternoons where you put on your headphones and enjoy the productivity included with your $4 cold brew. I completely lost track of time and was even happy that all of a sudden the place became so empty. Roughly 40min after the closing time....I realized the music stopped and shortly after I heard the glass doors being locked... I packed my things as I would on a super late morning, rushed downstairs and...found myself trapped inside like a desperate lab rat. I tried calling the number of the business but then saw the telephone right in front of me  ... I'm sorry but I had to peek inside the closet where I found a lanyard holding what looked like an access card, and phew!!--they worked at the back door! I kept the doors open and put the card back where I found them. I closed the doors behind. Sorry again! I didn't set off any alarms..will be more aware next time!!!",5.0,3/25/2019,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

Be aware of that! The atmosphere was great, i wish i could have stayed for longer. I highly suggest coming here!

Was looking for something quick so I just got their ""superfood oatmeal"" -- was not expecting much, but little did I know it would be hands down the best oatmeal I've had. They line the walls of the cup with peanut butter before filling it with oats, adding green apples, and drizzling some honey.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"Went here to get an iced chai latte with oat milk during a work lull on a hot day. The drink was good and I love how cold it was--almost like the ice cubes were shaped specifically to melt and cool the drink.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"All I have to say is - $5 for a blueberry muffin? Are you kidding me? Price wasn't listed and I admit it was my mistake for not asking first (I paid with the app so didn't see the total) but it was smaller than the size of my fist and I didn't think it would be so out of the realm of the other baked goods' prices. When I went back in and asked how much it had cost, the answer I received was: ""We bake them in-house."" That's perfectly reasonable -- it really is -- but at that price, you'd think it'd be a large enough muffin, and one of the best ones in town. In fact, the flavor was mediocre, and it was soggy in the middle. I'd asked for it to be heated up, but figured it would just be popped in the toaster or whatever. So I'm not sure how the sogginess occurred, but anyway.  Pic attached with a bottle of nail polish for scale. Size aside, it was a pretty average muffin. This was not worth it at all.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"Really, really good coffee - the drip comes in three different types that you dispense yourself and they even offer little cups for tasting before you commit to one. All of the coffees smell lovely and have a nice balance - nothing overly acidic or bitter; trust me, this stuff you can drink black even if you don't usually take your coffee that way. Do not ruin this coffee by adding copious amounts of milk or sugar.  The baristas pride themselves on the espresso drinks, and you can tell. I've never had a bad Flat White here; once, my order was taking a while and the barista came over to apologize because the first espresso shot he pulled wasn't good so he had to remake the drink.  I would come here everyday if I could, but unfortunately it is quite expensive, even for NYC standards; a bit of a downer, but I think they raised the prices recently to keep up with rent. Still - I try to swing by whenever I really need a pick-me-up.",4.0,4/30/2017,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

Decided to stop in today for an iced coffee, my typical go-to and readily available from over a dozen nearby coffee spots.    Coffee was good, but this place does not have it together.  The process of ordering and getting your food/drink definitely needs to be improved.  I ordered a simple cold brew with nothing in it and my order was forgotten, notwithstanding this it would have taken 10 min to get if not forgotten anyway.  The two workers repeatedly crossed each other up and it was confusing who was doing what.

With it being my first time here, I didn't know what to expect, but if you order ""for here"", it comes with a little tea cup and tea pot so you can manage how much tea you want at a time. If you ask for honey when you order, they provide the honey in a little side cup as well. A+ tea and presentation.  SERVICE | Yes, yes, yes. The barista is so friendly and excited about not only serving orders, but also interacting with the customers and co-workers. From sitting there, I could tell the barista really wanted to make sure everyone was enjoying themselves and that their drinks came out just right.  SPACE & AMBIANCE | I do not think upstairs seating was open because I came in the early morning hours. As for downstair- the space is a little small, but bench seating is available: it can probably fit around 6 people at a time. Ambiance is casual, comfortable, and friendly.

I came in during the work day morning rush and there were several customers both in front and behind me - and kept flowing in. Obviously a very popular place with the working professionals in the area so I would advise to expect a good 5-10 minutes wait after your order to get your coffee fix.

The layout is a little different since it's not really a bar with the baristas behind, it's more of two counters - one for ordering and one for the baristas to make the drinks and where they'll call out your name to pick up. They also have a bench for you to wait.  There's a lot more seating up stairs when they open for lunch service, but you're allowed to bring your coffee upstairs to enjoy.

Being our first time here got a helpful point in the right direction from the downstairs barista.  Upstairs tables are a little cozy, but the mid-morning buzz was nice for breakfast. The service left a lot to be desired though - we were seated upon arriving at the top of the stairs, but after about 10 minutes it seemed the hostess forgot about us. Frantically waved down a waitress, and ordered some avocado bowl and shakshuka. Food was pretty tasty, but when we asked for the check it took another 10 minutes to flag down the waitress.  Would have been four stars if the waitress/hostess paid a little more attention. Good food, subpart service.",3.0,3/22/2018,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

The food was not amazing and slightly overpriced, but hey, it's NYC so i'll accept it.  The reason for the two stars is for the lack of communication we received from our server regarding ""changes in the avocado market"".  Yeah, are you just as confused as I was?  I ordered avocado toast with salmon and an egg from this place, and the price listed on BOTH the cafe's blackboard and the menu was $15.50 (or something close to that number, I don't quite remember the exacts); the toast was pricey enough as it was, but when I received the check, the toast was somehow $3 more than the listed price. When I approached our waitress regarding the price of my toast, she nonchalantly told me that because there had been a ""change in the avocado market"", and overall the price of avocados have gone up, so they're charging customers more.  ......excuse me? if you're going to charge your customers more on something, shouldn't it be appropriate to at least inform them before they place their orders?  I was not hesitant on showing my dismay, and as a result, our waitress reluctantly took off the additional $3 on our check. Bottom line - the place itself is not bad, but the service can be a little questionable.",2.0,1/18/2018,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"Finally made it into this place as it's usually closed on the weekends and when I came on presidents day, they closed an hour early.. Yes, I should have called in advance to check.  I can't say much about this place as I only ordered a coffee. The cashier was on top of her game informing all arriving customers that there's no longer table service.  They only have espresso drinks and regular drips, no pour overs. Guess I had set my expectations in the wrong place too. That aside, the drop is actually decent. I had the one with a hint of blueberry and to my surprise, there was a hint of it. It's the ""wild"" flavor from Ethiopia.  I didn't make the trek upstairs as there's no table service any way. The first floor has a decent sized space. A little noisy but overall not bad.  Reading other people's reviews regarding price and quality and then to hear the recent omission of table service does have me wondering tho...

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"I wanted to explore the coffee shops in the hood and was following Yelp reviews. The coffee is okay but I've had better. Wouldn't recommend the americano, pick something else, too much water and tasteless. I see that others liked the latte, so maybe I should have picked that one. The place  is small downstairs. Not many seats, more of a takeaway place. And expensive, 4,50 for an americano which wasn't even good. But staff is really nice and it's a nice atmosphere. And the music is awesome! At least they got the music right. Their own vocabulary for coffee becomes confusing when you want to order. Short black, long black, flat white, pic/mac etc. It feels like they want to be hip, but making too much of an effort and in the end are not.",5.0,3/23/2018,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

This is a small little café spot with a chalkboard menu of espresso drinks and baked goods.  Wild Latte. Very simple latte art that is pleasing to the eye. There is a subtle aroma of blueberries and I could taste a bit of it when I took my first sip. This is one good cup of coffee.  The barista area is open so you can see your barista at work.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,Coffee and vibe are good but not good for meal. Came here for work lunch and staff told me the menu was not updated and only limited options were available. Ordered a miso poached egg bowl for $12 and got a tiny bowl only appetizer size. My friend got a slow cooked lamb ($18) and waited for like 20min until the food came (truly SLOWLY cooked). I also got a chai latte which was alright. Nothing really appealed to me and it was really unreasonably priced (probably because the huge space they are wasting while paying super high rent in midtown). Won't come back again for lunch. Might still drop by for coffee though.  Upside - the bowl was tasty and the menu looks pretty creative (with a lot of Asian fusion options like Bahn Mi).

All the baristas are great and you have a nice choice of different coffees. I usually go with the self-serve coffee with three different choices. They do the trendy thing with avocado toast and other similar pastries / dishes but have yet to try any of it.

I have countlessly said that I hate counter culture coffee.. But this place offers three different kinds of counter culture coffee tastes. I still love the wild one  But I somehow felt like that they made the coffee differently that I can finish my counter culture americano  GREAT  Service: people are so nice.

I expected a little more, a vegetable or a green or something in the rice.  When looking around other plates looked much more interesting.

Ricotta toast and shakshuka were both tasty. Then came time to get the check. That took another 10 minutes of waving. And then another 5 minutes of waiting for...I don't know what.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,Ellie our server was delightful! So smiley & bubbly. Very friendly. This place has a very cool vibe as you walk in. Downstairs is counter service & upstairs is table service. Both furnished minimalistly but tasteful. We went upstairs for table service. The music they play is hip & cool but not loud which I liked. I just don't like when it's so loud that you can't focus on a conversation face to face! I ordered a Brekie Sanga & hubby got the Corn pancakes. My sandwich was delicious and I usually like my order better than his. However I had some breakfast envy when his pancakes were served. He gave me a nibble-melt in your mouth good! He's also a bit of a coffee snob and was RAVING over how smooth the coffee was. Turns out they roast it in house. Also found out this place is a global chain.

Service was well-intentioned but sloppy: I ordered a cappuccino, 30 minutes later, I hadn't received it and couldn't track down the server to ask about it. I ended up placing the order again because it hadn't been put in the first time. Took another 20 minutes to get the coffee. Next, even though the music was not loud, the echoing of other guests' conversations made the noise level unsuitable for quiet work or a conversation.

The upstairs seating area is spacious, the tables along the back wall have outlets nearby which was helpful. I loved the wood industrial decor. The music is a bit loud. I would not recommend  hopping on a conference call (I tried, it was hard).  I started with a juice of carrot, apple, ginger which was delicious and had lovely color. The menu had several yummy sounding dishes, but I was intrigued by the curry chicken pot pie. It sounded really different and interesting. The pie itself was small, about the size of a large muffin, perhaps a little dry, but I liked it. The salad that came with it was tossed in a refreshing gingery dressing which was a good compliment to the pie.  I went downstairs a few times, and each time I saw the baristas either singing or dancing!

Everything about this cafe is very aesthetically  pleasing. The baristas and waitresses were always in good spirits and made each visit memorable both during peak and slow hours. It is a good place if you want to grab and go or sit upstairs and get some work done/have a meeting. I am looking forward to more cafe dates and reading at Taylor St Baristas!",5.0,7/25/2017,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919
Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"Excellent coffee complemented by great service. The pastries could use a bit of improvement, but the drinks are on point. Coffee prices are very reasonable for midtown Manhattan standards. The lovely staff and their infectious smiles at Taylor St are what makes the cafe truly awesome. The cafe is still relatively hidden given its location compared to more strategically situated competitors including Toby's, Grumpy, or Bluestone Lane. With that, it is still just an extra block or two further, and therefore a great spot with minimal risk of running into co-workers or your bosses!",4.0,1/2/2017,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919
Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"After living here 8 years, I want to support my fellow Aussies and love this place, but I can't.  The coffee is good but the food is not great at all.  I've given it a shot a number of times but most notably, the chia seed pudding is just sugar and water and the banana bread is incredibly disappointing.  See the photo for a picture of the dry burnt end of the loaf I was given after paying around $5.  Go for coffee, avoid the food.",5.0,9/30/2016,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919
Taylor St Baristas,4.0,The food is good but WOW it's overpriced! $6 for half a cup of sweet potato mash? $8 for a small piece of toast with avocado on it? I'm not made of money and I'm going to be hungry again in like an hour. Not impressed!,5.0,6/28/2017,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919
Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"I stopped by to get coffee / get some studying done while waiting for a train at Grand Central. This is a very upbeat/somewhat loud cafe. The vibe is great for grabbing coffee or a meal with a friend of stopping by on your way to work. Got a drip coffee (which comes in three varieties) and it's great. There are two floors - a to go spot downstairs and a table service area with lots of seating upstairs. Plenty of seating, but I wouldn't recommend coming here if your primary goal is to get work done, as it's just a bit too loud.",5.0,10/20/2017,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"I decide to read from my kindle at this cafe on a Monday afternoon. Walked in, and was pleasantly greeted. Apparently, seating is table service upstairs (leave a nice tip). I didn't feel rushed at all throughout my stay, and the service was exceptional. The main floor is for orders to go, with bench seating for waits.  I really enjoy the set up because this separation prevents disruption of your activity from people walking in and out. It's also very spacious (rare in the city) with tables well spaced throughout the room. The ambience, lighting, music selection and volume were just right. I'm definitely a big fan of this establishment.  Please continually order something as you work, I don't want this place to fold. Thank you!!",4.0,3/6/2017,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919
Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"So glad Taylor St opened in NYC. I first tried their coffee in London and absolutely loved it. It seems to have an extended menu compared to the shop I visited in London, including the classic, wild and decaf choices. I got a classic flat white, which was rich in flavor, delicately textured and had a very pleasant aftertaste. I'm excited to try the ""wild"" next time. The staff was also very friendly and had an Aussie accent. I later found out that even though the brand was founded in London, the owners were from Sydney! Having lived in London and Sydney, I was pleasantly surprised.",5.0,11/13/2016,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919
Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"I love Taylor St! The staff is so friendly and actually remembers your name (maybe this is because I come here quite often) and has a conversation with you.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"Stopped in for coffee and cake after a sushi lunch elsewhere.  We were sent upstairs for table service, and it was a good steer. The large flat whites were better than Bluestone Lane's, albeit pricier at $6.50. The slice of coffee cake was also pricey, but size justified the charge. I can't remember better service at a coffee house in Manhattan. Loved it.",4.0,11/12/2016,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"If I could go daily I would, but alas my retirement would be postponed.  The coffees here are delicious; however, there is a reason you only need to buy 4 to get one free, the coffee isn't cheap.  The best aspects of this shop are as follows: - I love that they have sample cups to try their hot coffee - food is healthy and good - chia pudding with mint and apple is light and healthy - cucumber salad with spice and peanuts - I could make this, but it's so nicely prepared - such friendly staff  Their teas and cold brews are also delicious!  Only draw backs: - no soy milk, but they have almond instead - the price (sigh it's NYC after all)",4.0,10/14/2016,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919
Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"I was catching up with a friend over coffee at Taylor St Baristas and I was immediately impressed by how cute the cafe was and how much room there was upstairs! My friend ordered a Flat White and I ordered their Homemade Chai Latte. Both were delicious. My friend said that she always does work there because there is a plethora of outlets and it has a really nice vibe. Although we didn't get food, the people around me ordered delicious-looking food. This place is highly instagram worthy and is a great place to study.  After I got back to my office, I realized that I left my scarf at the cafe. I immediately went into panic mode since it was a cashmere scarf and it was the first time I had worn it. I called the number on the Yelp page and I'm 99% sure I ended up leaving a voicemail on someone's personal cell phone. I sent them a message over Yelp, emailed them, and tweeted them. Luckily, after a few tweets back and forth, they told me that they had my scarf and that it was stored away. I realize how lucky I am and am so thankful for Taylor St Baristas' friendly service. My only suggestion for improvement is to correct the phone number (haha). I will most certainly be back again (and will try to remember all of my belongings)!",2.0,2/3/2017,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

I actually haven't had the chance to check out what the upstairs seating looks like, but the layout of the main floor is spacious and not chaotic. Sugar/straws/stirrers area always well-stocked. The only thing is that prices are steep, but they do provide loyalty stamp cards (buy 4 coffees, get the 5th free! Whaaat).  Love the vibe here.",4.0,3/6/2017,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

There is an upstairs to hide and eat all the banana bread one wants (order some salt on the side - you're welcome!) *updates: they have a new menu you guys and it's fabulous! I tend to 'get over' coffee shops and I am not over Taylor St Baristas. Their app is fabulous (although the app does charge an international fees when you load up - not sure why) but anywho, it's super convenient to place your order and have it waiting for you.

I exchanged some banter with the sweet blonde Aussie cashier over booming rap music (can you see why I love this place already?!) & five minutes later, my iced mocha was up. Bitter and sweet, and had a good ratio of almond milk to espresso. My vanilla lavender donut's pastel stripes and generous glaze was so pretty, I wanted to photograph it so that future generations of yelpers could admire its aesthetic!

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"Cute little spot that we slipped into.  Not too much variety, but love a spot that does a little and does it well.  Drinks were a little pricey (and really beautiful) but the food was reasonably priced.  We had the buttermilk scones which were the perfect amount of crunch on the outside and flaky on the inside.  The jam tasted homemade and was fresh and delicious.  The brekkie sanga was a real treat.  Crispy toasted bread with thick cut bacon, a rich cheese sauce and two eggs.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,Coffee is ok....better than most in NYC.....though a little too weak (even when ordering a double shot latte).

Portion of latte is small (but it's still perfect for me) and they had only one waitress serving everyone so she couldn't quite keep up - served my pastry with no napkins or eating utensil....but it all tasted good.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,It's easy to find good coffee in Midtown Manhattan but it ain't easy finding a staff that is so helpful and always serves your coffee with a smile. That makes Taylor St. different from every other coffee place around. Can't start my mornings now without my Flat white. They do have a variety of food offerings as well and some Aussie pastries that are hard to find around here.,4.0,6/7/2017,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919
Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"I moved to NYC in January not knowing much about coffee. However, since moving here I have learned a little (still have a long way to go) and can now decipher between a good cup of coffee and a bad one at the very least.  Taylor St Baristas is among my favorite coffee shops. Both of my jobs are in Midtown and this place is snug between them, which makes my life, a heck of a lot better. My friend and I did tai chi one morning before work in Bryant Park and set off to Taylor St since we had about 40 minutes to spare before we both needed to be at work.  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted like friends. The barista (wish I caught her name, shes originally from south Africa if employers are reading;) ) was super friendly and helpful as we asked questions about what their cafe is known for. Immediately gave us the history and culture behind the cafe, and explained to us about their popular flat white. She also explained to two different types. The classic (which is what I got) which gave it a smooth, chocolate taste, and the other one (my friend got) which had a more fruitful flavor. We also ordered a slice of banana bread to split. The barista also suggested that she put butter on it and warm it up for us (score!).  We went upstairs to sit, and when our items were ready the server brought them to us, Everything from the decorations, to the coffee, to the bread was amazing. It was one of the best flat whites I have ever had, and I can't wait to go back to try the more fruity one just to try!  Also, their royalty program is great. For every 4 coffees you buy, you get a fifth free!! Can't beat it!",5.0,6/23/2016,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919
Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"Five+ stars!  My favorite place for coffee in NYC!!!  Love the espresso here!!

The baristas are super friendly, the filtered coffee was probably the best tasting and caffeinated drink I've had since coming to NYC for the summer! It had a delicate taste of coffee but you can still taste the roast, it was honestly so good. The upstairs area is more for sitting down and eating, but it is a very cute layout even though the music is a little loud. Overall, cute place with amazing coffee; I don't frequent coffee places in Midtown often but I'd definitely come back here just for the coffee!!",4.0,7/21/2017,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

One of the better coffee shops in the area and in NYC which is not an east feat competing with Blue Bottle or Culture. Great loyalty program as others mentioned and super friendly staff with cool accents. Haven't tried the food outside of donuts which are great but look outsourced like the others.  The blends are interesting but would be nice to see a timer on the drips to see how old the brew is and I would like to see more options/more frequent changes of their blends.

I was expecting the usual coffee and pastries coffee shop, but to my surprise they have a full service restaurant, which they opened today (July 8, 2016). I ordered The Tower with an iced coffee (see photo). The guacamole lacked salt, but the chives and the cilantro relish that topped the open-faced sandwich balanced out the lack of salt. The poached egg was perfect- the whites were cooked through, but the yolk was still runny. The egg was well salted. The coffee is strong and bold, and for the price, you get a large glass.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"This is such a lovely little place tucked away just where you'd least expect it! If you're an avocado fan I really must urge you to get their avo toast. It is not the lazy version, they really know what they're doing-- it's nicely seasoned and has little slices of spicy pepper. They have some fantastic donuts as well, and I am a big fan of their matcha latte. Everyone who works there is also really friendly and warm, and seems to be happy to be there.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"So excited this great coffee shop opened in the neighborhood. I've been really pleased with my lattes the past two days. I tried the original espresso the first day and it was so smooth and delicious. Today I'm having my latte with the ""wild"" espresso and it has a wonderful deep flavor with a hint of blueberry which is a welcome addition. The staff is very friendly and the baristas seem to be a cut above. Also, right now they're having wonderful opening week prices so my drink was only $2.50. Looking forward to many more visits here, especially once the upstairs sit down cafe opens up.",2.0,4/26/2016,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919
Taylor St Baristas,4.0,Brilliant Aussie (or should I say Melbourne) style coffee!! Was greeted with the warm down under charm that I had became accustomed to in my time in Melbs. Then it was time to savor the flat white. No sugar of course. Absolutely spot on!!

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,Fantastic coffee and baristas. I was there a couple of days ago to get an espresso. Barista decide first shot was not good enough - I am sure I would not have even noticed. Came over to apologize for delay and explained why. And pulled a phenomenal shot afterwards. Love the attention to detail and the obvious love for their craft.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"Just got 2 coffees here and a hot chocolate, service was  very slow, even though place was not super busy, I ordered a Non fat Cap and two other drinks- all large. I watched the barista make it with whole milk. I asked her if it was skim when she gave it to me? she said we dont have skim milk, I said then why did the cashier take my order for  non fat cap then? She didnt like my question and gave me a major tude. All three large beverages  that i paid for were served as smalls. I just left and they kept my money. I  Will not be back.

The staff are exceptional not just at all things coffee, but also in overall friendliness and professionalism.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"Really disappointed in this new coffee shop - the attitude was way over the top, given the average coffee, warm/humid upstairs and limited hours.  My friend and I ordered iced lattes - the highfalutin coffee may have been tasty - but they only provided 1 shot in a $6 iced latte - and did not even ask if we wanted a second shot.  I'd characterize it as a $6 glass of iced milk.  We went upstairs to chat - nice space, but was way too warm and smelled off.  As we settled in for our iced milk, they announced that they were closing (at 5PM!)...  They must think that NY is like London (or Sydney) but I doubt that those cities close up at 5PM...  Overall, coffee and experience was 1 star, but 1 additional star for clean restroom.  Head to Fika or Aroma if you want a better cup of coffee in this neighborhood...",5.0,6/1/2016,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

Be aware that the ground floor is a small cafe meant for takeout while the upstairs portion is a sit-down restaurant with table service.  They don't really make this clear when you walk in.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"Dropped in here this afternoon for a quick coffee. Really cool vibe, great music and staff. They have their drip coffee with little tasters so you can get a sense for what you're going to drink. Prices are about average for a boutique coffee shop. I got a nonfat latte for $4.25 and it was really solid. Their food menu looked good but didn't try anything this time around.

Taylor St Baristas,4.0,"I remember reading an article on Sprudge last summer about Taylor St. opening an outpost in NYC near Grand Central. I kept checking back and was excited when they opened a few weeks back. The space is tucked away but once you walk in and see the menu you know it's a legit Aussie style cafe. Sleek, industrial and open, the space is great. You have incredibly friendly people working the counter who know you by name with some tasty food options. The coffee menu is traditional Australian with a proper flat white, piccolos etc...You're encouraged to chat with the baristas at the open espresso bar area. I didn't know what a piccolo was and Coco(head barista) not only explained the difference from a cortado but she actually showed me. Now it's my goto drink every morning. After the holiday weekend one of the baristas showed me photos from an art installation he went to. You become friends with them which makes for a much better, much richer experience. If you want quick coffee from a place like Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks or Aroma you have no shortage of options. But if you want hand crafted coffee treated with skill go to Taylor St. Chat them up and see if it doesn't become a part of your daily routine. It did for me.",5.0,6/2/2016,40.7514719404767,-73.9799013031919

Music isn't too loud, people go there to do work which seems like what it's designed for.

Post- 5 am workout, I mentioned I was hungry and asked what's good that's low carb - ready to BUY a meal - and   greeted with a blank stare. I got a coffee but i think the quality may be distorted by the sour taste the service left in my mouth.  The last thing I want to do is shake off bad attitudes when i need my morning coffee.

My friend and I arrived around 11 on a Saturday morning. When I usually come here it's in the morning and it's almost always busy. After walking in I scouted the place to see where available seating would be. The second floor was completely filled, but I was able to find a table on the first floor that had just had people leave it. Advice, get here early so you're table to stake out your preferred spot.  When it came time to order I went with the matcha latte ($5.50) and my friend went with the media americano ($5). Good quality overall, also if you let them know you're enjoying you beverages at the location they'll serve it in a mug.  This is a great spot to study or read a book! It's also great to catch up with a friend, but for that I'd stick to the first floor. The second floor usually has people working on their laptops, but during the warmer months the patio out in the back is a must.",4.0,2/3/2019,40.7675191,-73.9893618

My fiance and I decided to get out of the house one day to do get some work done and be productive, so we headed out to FIKA, which turns out to be one of the only cafes in the area with more than ample seating space.  There's some seating  downstairs and tons of seating upstairs, but we found that it was pretty packed late in the afternoon on a Saturday.  I guess people figured out earlier than us that this was a great spot to get work done.  The ceilings are high and the temperature is good, so people basically live here all day, I guess.  Wifi was decent, though it would slow down randomly.  Lighting is great, if you like the fluorescent lighting.  The customers here seem to mind their own business for the most part and there wasn't really any one distracting or annoying.  I had a dirty chai which was very much on the spicy side; all their drinks seem to be a little overpriced, but you pay for the ambience and the space to study, so I don't mind that much.  Pastries are half off after a certain time (I forgot when).  Pastries were nothing to call home about.  Workers start shouting that the store will be closing 15 min prior to closing.

There were some people having quiet conversations but mostly other people were working, so it's easy to focus.  I got their salmon wrap, which was pretty decent. Mostly a lot of arugula, but the mustard dipping sauce was tasty. Also got the matcha latte which was very spot-on! It has a strong matcha flavor and I like that they don't sweeten it (but you can add sugar yourself.) They have a huge truffle selection, which I didn't sample but definitely want to next time.  Only con of the place is that there are next to no outlets. I saw only one on the second floor that was already occupied. Other than that, a really solid cafe spot.",5.0,5/10/2017,40.7675191,-73.9893618
FIKA,4.0,"I love a place that has free wifi and ample seating to sit and work. However, there are only a few plugs, so come with your laptop charged.  I really appreciated how there were two floors, and also an outside patio. It was beautiful weather out, so I opted for the outside patio.  The music that was playing inside was way too upbeat for a coffee place. Also, everybody inside looked really cold, so I don't know why they did not turn their air-conditioning down.  However, they have good prices for their coffee and had pastries that looked delicious. I would definitely come back to study again!",4.0,9/17/2017,40.7675191,-73.9893618
FIKA,4.0,"Haven't been to other branches, but love the layout of this one! Tons of seats and great minimalist decor with pops of color. Only con is that they don't have as many outlets as you would like.  Can get pretty noisy at times so don't expect peace and quiet, but if you're comfortable with popping in some headphones while working, this is your place! I came here to get some work done early on a Friday afternoon and it was great. Got the matcha tea latte for $5 and it was a good, simple drink. Definitely not overly sweet in any way and was just a nice, light drink.",5.0,12/30/2016,40.7675191,-73.9893618
FIKA,4.0,"While I want to leave a better review for this location because it's my everyday go-to for the past few years...I'm stunned at how dirty its become. Literal filth. I don't think they sweep or mop that place but once a month. The cloth chairs are completely stained and you're hesitant to sit on them. I don't ever want to bring people here for a coffee chat because it's so utterly gross to sit in. The amount of crumbs, dust, and hair on the floor are enough to make this place seem icky like it should have a B rating. And judging by the cost of coffee, you would think they could afford cleaning supplies.  The staff is 50/50 when it comes to you feeling like you're inconveniencing them for wanting to order a coffee or anything in general. Especially the guy in the morning with the long beard. He couldn't be less interested or more rude.  If they would clean the place daily and have employees that were nice- it would be more inviting. My recommendation: go to Rex up the street. It's much nicer and friendlier.",4.0,9/17/2018,40.7675191,-73.9893618
FIKA,4.0,"Spacious place with a lot of natural light. There isn't much of an ambience but it's a good spot to get some work done. The small outdoor patio at the back of second floor was very nice, and seemed to be quieter than indoors. The service is friendly and cordial, but the space can definitely be kept cleaner--there were trash and uncleaned stains on some tables.  Drinks are decent but the food is pretty bland and a little pricey.",3.0,8/25/2017,40.7675191,-73.9893618

FIKA,4.0,"3.5/5  I was looking for a coffee shop to do some work in, and I happened to see that this FIKA is nearby. I've always appreciated the care FIKA gave to developing its coffee spaces (plus the coffee is decent), so I opted to check out this Hell's Kitchen FIKA. I ordered a drip - it's as expected, nothing wowtastic. The space itself is very nice, with two floors and ample natural lighting via a skylight. The internet works well.  BUT  I'm docking 1 star from the otherwise 4.5 star rating, because the staff hasn't kept this beautiful space clean. There is garbage and dirty dishes on tables, crumbs and coffee stains on others. No matter how beautiful the space is, these remnants of old customers make this space unpleasant to work in.  So, a word to FIKA: a little goes a long way. Maintain your beautiful space, or lose out on potential repeat customers.",3.0,7/31/2017,40.7675191,-73.9893618

FIKA,4.0,"I'd give the coffee 2 stars for the latte, but coupled with the space they occupy, it's bumped up to a 3 star place.  I ordered a latte (single shot, whole milk) and found it extremely weak and milked-down, for lack of a better term. The color was extremely light brown, almost white. I'd guess the larger cups in comparison to the volume of the shot expression leads it to be on the milkier side. Starbucks, in my opinion and usually my middle-of-the-road indicator, makes a stronger latte than Fika.  The location, though, is what makes Fika great. It's incredibly bright and modern. It has two stories and an outdoor patio on both. It has floor-to-ceiling windows and is well air-conditioned for the warm NYC summer. I felt well refreshed after my walk around the city thanks to Fika.",4.0,7/12/2017,40.7675191,-73.9893618
FIKA,4.0,"FIKA is one of my favorite coffee shops in the city, taking into account the fact that it is a chain-store. As a Swedish espresso shop, FIKA indicates ""coffee for a break"", and provided me that exact relaxed feeling, once having a sip.  Aside from the drinks, FIKA is also renown for its truffle selections, with wine-infused or not. Pastries were equally tasty.  This location has a much larger space for seating.

FIKA,4.0,"Spacious, modern and cozy Swedish cafe in Hell's Kitchen that's good for big group or a couple of friends or just working there alone. The space is very bright and things are very well arranged in a way that different groups have their own space and won't interfere with each other.  I came here for a big group meeting as this FIKA is relatively big compared to other locations. There are two floors and there is plenty of space on the second floor. We had 9 people and it perfectly fitted us. We had 2 hours of discussion and the discussion was very productive and efficient, thanks to the great space.  I ordered a Chai Latte and it was not bad. The price is also pretty standard - $4~5 for a latte. There is wifi in the cafe. Their pastries also look amazing; am probably going to try some next time!",4.0,1/22/2017,40.7675191,-73.9893618
FIKA,4.0,"This is my favorite neighborhood coffee shop! They have free wifi and gorgeous seating. The outdoor porch seating on the second floor looks like you are in a garden. I could easily wile away the day here.  I ordered the green tea latte ($4.59) and was extremely impressed! They used plenty of matcha powder so the latte had tons of flavor. The barista finished off the drink with an adorable lead design, which added to the experience. My only warning, however, is to order the sweetened latte. I generally do not like sweet drinks, so I got it unsweetened. The matcha powder tends to taste very grassy and bitter without any sweetening.  If you have LevelUp, make sure to use it here for $3.00 off your first purchase.  Although there's plenty of seating upstairs, there are not many outlets. So if you are using a laptop, it might be a good idea to charge it at home first.",4.0,6/25/2016,40.7675191,-73.9893618

I ordered an iced chai and although it wasn't my favorite iced chai I've ever had, I really am inclined to come back again and try a different drink off of their menu since so many other people have listed drink reviews that they love from here. I also would come back just for the quiet, yet upbeat atmosphere which is so far what I love most about this place.",4.0,6/13/2018,40.7675191,-73.9893618

There's 2 stories and there's even an outdoor seating space that has a nice gardenish vibe to it. There's even a small bar in the 2nd floor. It's a great place to bring in your laptop and do some works, meet up with friends or just relax over some drinks and munchies.    The foods and drinks however are okay, average perse. I ordered the matcha latte and Mazarin.  The matcha latte was tastless however the texture was good. The Mazarin has dust on the top, it's looks like it's been sitting out for a while.

FIKA,4.0,"This FIKA location has two floors and an outdoor patio on the second floor. It's really well kept and spacious. The skylight lets in a lot of light, great place to read a book or study... but if you need wi-fi to do work, you're best bet is somewhere else. The wi-fi here is SO SPOTTY. It literally cuts off every 5 minutes and you have to keep clicking connect and agreeing to terms again and again. I was in the middle of filling out an application and when I hit save, there was a 50/50 chance that it was able to without having disconnected and then losing everything.  The coffee was meh. I ordered a cold brew and I have to admit that Starbucks is better (on a good day of course, they definitely tend to also have a hit or miss rate).

I had enough when he asked me to move from my seat because he wanted to use that particular place for one of these meetings. Not cool, man. Especially not when it's such a spacious place with plenty of available seats!

Not enough plugs though.  If this place wasn't so dang far from the subway I'd definitely be coming back more often. But having been here twice at what otherwise is peak time (weekend late morning) this FIKA location seems to always benefit from that distance by being wonderfully calm and not-crowded.

FIKA,4.0,"FIKA is an amazing study space. Lots of light pours through the huge floor to ceiling window at the front and the outdoor patio is amazing on a nice sunny day. Food is not the best. I get sick of it because of the similar flavors across the board. The pancakes were more like crepes and were a little pricey at over $9 for 3 measley (nonfilled) crepes dusted with powdered sugar. The drinks come unsweetened so if you have a huge sweet tooth, this is not the place for you. Prepare to bring a sweater if you intend on staying because they blast the AC. WiFi is a hit or miss and outlets are sparse so come with a fully charged laptop.

The scrambled egg breakfast was delicious and has a good portion of everything (loved the sourdough bread). The spicy hot chocolate (made with Valrhona chocolate) had a nice kick to it without the spice being overpowering.

FIKA,4.0,"Summary:  Gorgeous space done in Swedish style. Slightly pricier, but worth being in a great environment.  Healthy food options. A little cold on the A/C.  Atmosphere: If you just got back from Scandinavian travels and miss their sun loving minimalist style, this is your shop.  The minimalist lines and cleanliness screams brightness.  This is one of my happy places.   As for seating, downstairs, upstairs and outdoor, to me all have their own vibe.    Service:  Very pleasant folks at the front who smile and are efficient. Their process is slightly confusing.  The register guy is the only guy that will take your order. Everyone else is dedicated to getting your drinks sorted.  Then it all comes together at the register. You order, you pay, you get your drink they give you a number for your food and you are off to find a seat.  The Food & Coffee:   Coffee:  They use great coffee. I don't know the name of it, (will update), but it will meet any coffee lover's need.  They do have soy milk as an option.  Just ask.  While coffee is served in a mug, all other warm beverages are served in a coffee mug with saucer and the foam is beautifully placed on top.  Portions aren't bad, though I do think they are slightly pricier than other spots.  I'm cool to pay up though and I think if they were cheaper, you'd have too many people flooding into the space.  The food: The portions are a normal European size and they focus on using good ingredients. I really enjoyed the Swedish meatballs with potatoes gravy and lindenberry jam which you can also order for brunch.    Little note: In the bathroom, it's a little unclear how someone would dry their hands. Not sure if you were just out of paper towels.  I wasn't the only one in my group to note confusion.",5.0,9/3/2015,40.7675191,-73.9893618

Same happens to the next customer, he only put his phone down when he actually has to pick up something with his both hands.

The menu is year-around and fairly priced - house brewed coffee comes in small (2.30), M ($2.76), and L ($3.21), and they have a variety of specialty drinks like hot chocolates (great in the winter), matcha tea lattes and cappuccinos all under $4.50. If I'm coming in the morning, I might do the ""build your own breakfast"" option ($5-$10), or just get a pastry - baked in house and delicious. With upstairs and downstairs seating options along with an outdoor patio, the ambience here is beyond comparison to other local alternatives like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts, or the new but small shop Rex.

FIKA,4.0,"Where am I?! Am I still on 10th avenue? Sitting from the inside looking out, I almost feel like I am on 5th avenue or some other more affluent parts of Midtown (versus the wild west - who voluntarily comes out to 10th avenue & beyond?).  FIKA's design is modern, minimalist, and sleek, with light classical music playing in the background. The floor-to-ceiling glass-walled store front, as well as the sunroof, allows ample natural light. I mean, even most of the patrons there look like well-dressed young professionals typing away instead of the disheveled student type cramming for exams. Colorful and comfortable chairs dot the upper level, and modern tables with small trash cans line the walls. There is an open space patio as well for the warmer months, which I think will be quite enjoyable.  As for the drink and fare, it tastes just like any other chain stores taste like - average and soul-less. It's not horrible, but not delicious, and gets the job done whether you need caffeine or munchies. The strength of the coffee shop is definitely the ambiance, which I am not sure how it will be once the word gets out and it becomes crowded.  Although I'm a bit sad that chain stores have finally invaded the wild west, I am thankful for the ample and comfortable space available for doing work.",4.0,2/18/2015,40.7675191,-73.9893618
FIKA,4.0,"After having visited Sweden a few years back, my interest was piqued when I discovered Fika. This is my favorite location, thanks in large part to the ample seating and friendly staff. Their chocolate truffles are no joke. I usually stick with their iced Americano or latte, and yes they have soy milk.  Given that I'm usually studying/have little time for a regular meal in some cases, their protein bar does wonders. It's rare to say a protein bar tastes good, but these are addicting. Luckily they're super filling, so one is enough for a while. If I could, I'd buy these in bulk.  The only drawback is the relative lack of outlets, but that's I guess in line with the idea of a fika being a break, not a time to work.",4.0,5/29/2016,40.7675191,-73.9893618
FIKA,4.0,"I'd like to give FIKA a 1 STAR and a 5 STAR. For the most part, I adore FIKA on 10th Av. I don't come here for simply the coffee. The Staff is wonderful.  I know them, they know me... Adele is lovely and good at her job. and it's clear she enjoys it. The coffee is great, strong. The inside... It's large. Spacious. Rarely crowded, but when it is, it's very crowded. That is when the minimalist interior becomes frustrating.  BUT... my review is about the Wi-fi. Wi-Fi is everywhere now. Quite often I need to be watching or working directly through the internet. If this is of great importance to you, and you will be depending on the Wi-fi... stay clear. There are signs all over FIKA that ask patrons to be considerate and basically not hog the wi-fi. The fact they'd need to put these signs around tells me that they are aware of the problem... and asking the patrons to fix the problem for them, rather than address it themselves. FIKA isn't cheap... in comparison, a second or third router is not expensive nor complicated. They obviously addressed the problem for the staff, with 2 networks, a FIKA network and FIKAoffice network. I have said something many times. That's when the signs went up. Sure, Internet is fickled, yes. but It saddens me to know, before even walking in the door, that I can not depend on FIKAs internet to work, nor for management to do anything about it. What saddens me even more (and makes me little ill) is that Now I find myself having to literally leave and go to Starbucks... only because their Wifi is far more dependable. Scary.  Don't hate on FIKA. But DO hate on the attention being paid to ""Coffee House Standard"" by management. At the very least, decent Wi-fi is a given at any coffee shop. This, unfortunately isn't even decent... nor short-term, apparently. I'm writing this from FIKA and I'm having trouble just posting this.  Side note... Hardly any plugs. Also something that has a simple, inexpensive solution. I bring my own multiple plugs extension. This way I know I'll have a plug... which tends to have several others asking to plug into it. Of course they can. As a customer, I can bring a solution with me... yet management can't figure one out?! Not good customer service.  I keep checking back in to see if there has been change and over the year.  there has been no change... in fact, it's gotten worse.  So, bottom line, if I don't need to be committed to internet use, I come for the staff, and the  coffee. not the former.",4.0,4/17/2016,40.7675191,-73.9893618

They even give me recommendations when I'm trying to pick jams. Btw, the jam is great! I bought blueberry and raspberry flavor. It indeed has blueberries in it. The citrus and whisky flavor is special and tasty too. Just everything is good and better than any other jams I have ever tried before.

The macchiato wasn't bad, but wasn't spectacular either. Side note: I felt like my finger was going to get stuck in the handle.  The meatball dish was great. It was served with a side of mashed potatoes, a salad, and lingonberries. The portions were great and felt adequate. Their was a mixture of baby tomatoes on the salad, including little heirlooms.

FIKA,4.0,"Fika is a spacious, sleek, minimalist  coffee shop with pops of color ranging from orange and green chairs to wired lights. Even with these pops of color, this place is able to give off the mellow ambiance of a coffee shop.  As for the coffee itself, it was alright. It's a chain coffee shop so we weren't expecting anything mind blowing. We came here after dinner for a little dessert. We got a chocolate mousse dome which was decadent but lacked that mousse texture. We also got a cookie that was very crunchy. You get what you pay for.

FIKA,4.0,"I would have LOVED this place to be around the last time I went to see a taping of ""The Daily Show"". It was a comfortable respite instead of just, say, eating a deli sandwich in DeWitt Clinton Park, impatiently trying to kill two hours before getting back in the ticket line while your phone's battery slowly dies. (Not that *I* would know...)  I've been to a FIKA before (...see my Review of the Day for 5/1/15! yelp.com/biz/fika-new-yo…), so I was pretty excited to not only see this one in Hell's Kitchen, but I was intrigued by the rooftop garden! Sure enough, after the Beau and I ordered our delicious iced coffee and strawberry iced tea, respectively, plus a chocolate pastry, we walked upstairs to a second level split between tables and a bar (Happy Hour starts at 4!) and a quaint outdoor sitting area with, easily, room for a dozen people between the community picnic table and various small tables and seats. We even found a couple of plugs to charge our dying phones as we sipped and nibbled away. The pastry was delicious, an almost graham cracker-esque pastry sprinkled with large chunks of decorative sugar. The tea was refreshing and had a genuine strawberry flavor, and, though not a coffee fan, the iced coffee was also delicious, quite smooth, actually.  This little area of Hell's Kitchen is pretty devoid of...well, a lot. Haaa. A friend of mine used to live in the Archstone apartment complex on 54th, and the CVS was the only shining beacon in the neighborhood for a long time, it seemed. Finally, there is a little upward growth! FIKA is a great addition.",5.0,5/13/2015,40.7675191,-73.9893618

FIKA,4.0,"Hm, in this little section of Hell's Kitchen, I couldnt justify coming here. You've got Rex a block north, which has great coffee and some food - so the only reason I'd go to Fika is because of the obviously superior seating there. With that in mind, you have Cafe Ole just a block south, which although small always has seating. Fika is just so damn.... bland - there's no character to it. I'm admittedly not into the Scandinavian aesthetic, so my opinion was nearly decided before I tried this. Whatever, it's the 13th location, I'd rather be somewhere with the owner in house.  Unless you have a party of more than 4, check out Rex or Cafe Ole first.",4.0,1/2/2015,40.7675191,-73.9893618

They happened to be playing a John Legend album when I was there. The bathroom is clean. The back patio on the 2nd floor, a sweet surprise! I can imagine it being a nice hang-out spot on a summer evening.  I only had the spicy hot chocolate from here. It was thick and indulgent. It wasn't overpoweringly spicy and the chocolate is good quality. It seems the richness varies per location, though. The Chelsea one tends to make it weaker.",4.0,4/25/2015,40.7675191,-73.9893618
FIKA,4.0,"The good thing about this chain is the coffee consistency. Always very good. Service is always fast. I think this is the latest location to open and is way over in Hell's Kitchen. It is reeeeeally nice and very large and spacious. We found a table to sit immediately. I just love the vibe here. Clean and bright and airy.  Unfortunately, the food is not good at all. I had a wrap and it was totally lacking flavor. It was like eating nothing. My friend ordered the shrimp salad. She said the bread was really fresh but the shrimp salad itself was not fresh and had no flavor either. She told me she had the same item at their location way downtown and she loved it, but this time it wasn't good at all.  Our third friend ordered meatballs and said they were a little greasy and cold.  None of us finished our lunches. Too bad.    I'm not sure why this chain has such good coffee but such inconsistent food. When it's good, it's good and then, like this location, it's not.  I will continue to order coffee and bakery items (the bakery items I've had are also quite good), but the food is so ""hit or miss""  that I won't risk getting lunch at Fika anymore. It's a waste of money because you never know what you'll get.",5.0,2/8/2015,40.7675191,-73.9893618

It can get a bit crowded at times, certainly more so than when they opened, as more people find out about it and get hooked. But I've always managed to get a spot.  The place is large with two levels and features a very sleek modern decor. When they first opened, that felt lie a bit of a jolt, since it was so different then the cramped-casual aura of nearby Rex and Khave. But now, I'm used to it.

Apartment buildings are springing up everywhere so thankfully the bodegas and filthy joints are beginning to disappear. Fika is helping to clean up the block in the mid-50s.  The food was pretty good and I was happy that I was able to order half a sandwich, even though they don't make that very clear on the menu board. Saved some money and still had plenty to eat. Unfortunately, there wasn't much smoked salmon in the wrap I got, but for six dollars I guess I shouldn't expect much. The food is fresh and there is a good variety.

FIKA showing up in Hell's Kitchen gives me hope that the neighborhood is on the trendy up and will finally be a desirable place to not only live, but to hang out.

Fantastic place to study, Its well lit, clean,modern (Is the furniture all from Ikea?)  and refreshing change of pace from the typical ""so cozy you can't see anything"" coffee shops. Plus when i was there it had good music, but nothing over powering.  I enjoyed the upstairs seating area, large tables with a nice view out the big front window.  There was a patio as well which was closed because it was cold at the time.   The coffee was very good, mild not bitter.  I was very happy with it.

Then Rex moved in -- a wonderful coffee spot with excellent food, drink and very little seating. Then Fika came along, with its spare, minimal aesthetic, it's bilevel goodness, it's ample seating (with wifi! And a few power outlets!) and even an outdoor space. My god, it's every work-from-home's dream come to life.  I love that there's a bunch of seating, I love that there's so much space, I love the decor, I love the coffee here.

FIKA,4.0,"Had a great lunch experience at FIKA this week. First of all the space is beautiful. I've never been to another one of their locations to compare but, for this area on 10th Ave, the space is amazing. I ordered the soup of the day, which was Creamy Zucchini, Spinach, and Scallion, and the Chevre Salad. The soup was served in a fairly large sized bowl with 3 slices of bread. The flavors and texture were pleasing and overall it was a nice accompaniment to the salad. Their Chevre salad was served in a large bowl and had an insane amount of goat cheese which I was able to spread on some of the bread that was served with my soup. The beets and candied walnuts were delicious and the honey lemon vinaigrette was the right balance of sweet and tart. This was the best salad I've had in a long time. I will definitely be back to try their sandwiches and other treats. The coffee was excellent as well, and you can enjoy free refills if you are staying. Service was friendly and attentive. We made sure to thank them as we left letting them know that it was our first time and that we enjoyed everything.",4.0,1/15/2015,40.7675191,-73.9893618
Maman Nomad,4.0,"We walked in here on a Sunday brunch. We were seated within 10 minutes. I got their Americano, it was good. I liked the coffee. It was good. I got the Hashbrown waffle dish.  I wasn't sure what to expect really, but it's like a salad with toppings of cucumbers, a poached egg?, salmon and the waffle hash brown.  Overall, it was good, but some of the ingredients didn't mix for me. I probably wouldn't get it again.  We saw that they had some desserts, so I got the pistachio pastry and the nutty chocolate chip cookie. the chocolate chip cookie is one of Oprah's favorite things. But, personally, I enjoyed the pistachio pastry more.  If I were in the neighborhood, I'd go back for the pistachio pastry again.  It has a pistachio filling that I really enjoyed.  Overall, I liked the ambience of the place, the left side of the wall has a flowery design with a wiring shadow look. Great photo opp for the IG'ers.",5.0,3/6/2019,40.7432672,-73.9901338

My friend and I ordered brunch items which were the breakfast sandwich and the hash brown bowl with smoked salmon. Both were completely disappointing. The salad which came with both plates was old and brown, and the hash brown were grey and soggy. Disgusting, and inedible.  We left reeking like the restaurant, which was filled with smoke from the food being cooked in the kitchen.

So I was in NY for business and on the way to my office I decided to stop by and grab a cup of coffee. Normally I am a latte guy but decided to go with a Chai Latte. Unfortunately it did not taste good at all, the spice was overwhelming to the point I could almost not even taste the coffee in it.

Maman Nomad,4.0,"Really cute coffee shop with food in Nomad neighborhood. Actually feels more like you're at a cool cafe in a small city than in NYC - they're much too friendly and homey to be hardened Apple denizens!  Beautiful coffee art made with love. Very tasty latte with a lovely flower.  Food quite good.  Greek yogurt parfait was delicious with full fat yogurt, great berries, and good granola.  Smashed avocado toast was good; I added a fried egg. I wish the toast had been hot when I got it; lukewarm is not how I prefer avocado toast, but it was still good. Avocado tartine is actually made with egg salad, avocado and watermelon radishes. It looked pretty, but I don't like egg salad in the am.  You order at the counter and then sit down.  Definitely homey, no attitude, and they're super friendly. Much more fun than going to an overpriced, pretentious brunch place in the neighborhood to have ordinary omelettes at a more expensive price. But it was not my fave avocado toast of all time.",4.0,1/2/2019,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"I go all over the place with this chain. As everyone mentions, the decor and ambiance are adorable and welcoming. It's like having a tea party with your chic french grandma.  The ordering system is a little awkward if you're eating in. You seat yourself, I forget if me and my friend got menus or were given them. You get up to order your coffee or whatever at the barista station in front, and you get up to order your food from the counter in the back. The food is brought to you, the drinks you get yourself. It's a casual whimsical place, and it wasn't busy so this worked but it feels odd.  Maman, any of them, make one of the best chai lattes I've ever had, ditto for their almond croissants. The chai is heavily spiced, very aromatic, sweet without being a Starbucks syrup bomb. The croissants are generously packed with what I always think of as almond paste, covered with almond slivers, and sprinkled with confectioners sugar. I adore it.  This was my first time sitting down for a meal. My friend ordered the Waffle-iron hashbrowns* with smoked salmon, avocado, cucumber, balsamic mixed greens, lemon, dill & a soft boiled egg. The * indicates the dish is gluten free, which is fine because none of those should have gluten, and everything was delicious, except the hash browns. They were a soggy mess, not crispy, not seasoned, and tasted like they tried to use a healthier potato replacement instead of real potatoes. I don't know what was going on. The other ingredients were great, but with no hash it's a smoked salmon salad.  I ordered their namesake breakfast sandwich: bourbon bacon jam, avocado, roasted tomatoes, topped with a fried egg on a cornmeal focaccia bun. It was good, and I think some people would even say really good, but the jam was too sweet for me. There wasn't really something meaty or savory enough to cut through it, even with the bacon incorporated into it. The avocado, the runny egg, it was just a lot of ooey-gooey textures and sweetness.  I think I like Maman more for their pastries and ambiance than their most substantial fare.",3.0,12/15/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

The kitchen doesn't open until 8am but I think the store in general is open much earlier.  They have plenty of seating in the middle, with free water and WiFi. The front is only for coffee drinks and some pastry, the cold brew was really great.  The back has many good breakfast options from quiche to salads and tartines, the girl in the back was super friendly and made my tartine into a salad allowing me to pretend to keep keto- the salad was amazingly fresh!

I come here occasionally for pastries and coffee. The pastries are fine when the craving strikes, but average in New York where there's a sea of excellent pastry options.  The cookies are overhyped- I found them incredibly sweet and texturally uninteresting. I like the variety of savory breakfast options.

I guess those chalkboard signs really work, huh?  The place itself is so beautiful! If I worked or went to school in the area this would be a great place to sit down with a computer or even to relax or catch up with a friend. There's a lot of seating room and also the wallpaper is so cute!  They have a bunch of regular espresso drinks you would find at a coffee shop with a few fun flavors. The line to order is right by the door which can get really cramped with people walking in and out. There were also people just hovering over that section so it was a little annoying to order because you weren't sure if the hoverers were ordering or not.  When I ordered my drink I go around the corner of their table to wait for my drink. It came out so beautiful with a little heart and cute little lavenders as decor. The lavender looks esthetically pleasing but drinking I was a hassle because it felt like you kept getting attacked by little petals. I liked my drink but I always compare my lavender lattes to the one from Laughing Man which was the best I've ever had but it's also in Tribeca and I don't like traveling that downtown. I'd probably order their regular coffee/espresso drinks to get a better feel of their drinks though next time.",3.0,10/22/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

I had the Maman's Breakfast Sandwich which has (a very thin) layer of avocado on seeded bread, a sunny side up egg, roasted tomatoes, and jam flavored bacon. It was actually much more delicious than I'd expected for a cafe sandwich. The White Chocolate Matcha Croissant is just meh even tho I'm always biased when it comes to matcha. They serve Toby's Estate coffee here - solid.  The place does get crowded and very noisy during morning coffee and lunch hour but other than that it's bearable.

My friend and I waited for 15 minutes and got seated at a communal table (very spacious so it wasn't a problem).  I ordered a latte, which was solid, but nothing life changing. My friend and I both got the breakfast sandwich (added chicken per the waitress's suggestions), and oh my god, I was SHOCKED. It is by far the breakfast sandwich I have ever had in my life, no doubt. The chicken itself isn't amazing, but it is an incredible addition combined with the rest of the sandwich. The bacon jam really makes the whole thing (sounds disgusting, but truly life-changing). My friend is a health nut and doesn't get carried away with enjoying food, but he also vocalized how good it was. Life changed. I will be back over and over again for this sandwich alone.  Got a raspberry rose pound bread on the way out, also very solid. I will definitely be back for the white chocolate matcha croissant, which they have every day but sells out quickly in the AM.  GET.

Maman Nomad,4.0,"I was a big fan of their Soho location when I lived in the area, so was really excited to check out their Flatiron outpost during a recent lunch outing, especially because I'd only ever tried their delicious baked goods and coffee, and not their real food options.  Turns out, they have a ton of great stuff for lunch, too! I couldn't resist the waffle iron hash brown bowl which came with smoked salmon, avocado, eggs, and veggies. I wished the hash browns were a tad more crispy on the outside, but other than that I was so happy with it. And the portion size was perfect! It was great washed down with their special rose matcha limeade, which was refreshing and mild, though I couldn't really taste the rose part. My dining companions got sandwiches, which they also loved, and we shared one of their gooey nutty chocolate chip cookies, which the guy behind the counter nicely let me select (I got one with lots of crispy edges).  The space is rustic and gorgeous. I could imagine some wonderful bridal showers or birthday parties happening here if they ever shut down the space for private events (not sure if they do). They definitely started to get more crowded during lunch time so an early  meal or off-hour hang is probably your best bet, but there are lots of tables to choose from.

Maman Nomad,4.0,"Maman's cookies didn't really need Oprah's endorsement; everyone was already aware of their greatness before they earned a spot on her ""favorite things"" list. If anything, her praise just made their baked goods even fresher, since the increase in demand ultimately led to a larger quantity of cookies leaving their ovens. Of course, the downside to this is that the bakery often sells out well before closing time.  It makes sense, though. The nutty chocolate chip cookie is delicious. In my opinion, its flavor can be attributed to two characteristics: a crispy exterior (particularly the edges) and the inclusion of macadamia nuts. The macadamias are soft and creamy, forming a contrast with the crunchy outside layer. Almonds and walnuts can also be found among the composition, but are rather forgettable when the macadamias are taken into account.  As a whole, the cookie is buttery and slightly salty, due to the combination of the nuts and a little added sea salt. It tastes even better warmed up, when the chocolate chips are partially melted - you know, like in one of those slow-motion cookie breaking Instagram posts.  Stop by any of Maman's six New York locations early in the day and grab yourself a nutty chocolate chip cookie. It might just make your own personal list of favorite things!",4.0,12/31/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

Maman Nomad,4.0,"~ review is for bakery ~  // Nutella Beignet The Nutella Beignet is one of the most decadent doughnuts you'll ever eat. The sugar dusted beignet has a dough texture that is extremely fluffy. I'm talking pillow fluffy. You'll also notice the color of the exterior is a beautiful golden brown. It's topped with a dollop of Nutella and little beads of chocolate. But the best part? It's filled with gobs of Nutella. As soon as you take a bite you'll get hit with a Nutella Bomb.  // Choc Chip Cookie The chocolate chip cookie here is another must-have bakery item. It seems like this is one of the lesser mentioned chocolate chip cookies in the competitive NYC chocolate chip cookie scene. But I think it's one of the most underrated and should be up there with the best chocolate chip cookies.  It's just crisp enough on the outside with a soft interior and a mix of solid and melting chocolate chips. The color and composition of the cookie dough varies throughout, and the shape isn't a perfect circle. This makes for a much more interesting cookie. I think completely uniformity in dough is boring. What elevates it even more is the crunch and nuttiness from macadamia nuts, walnuts, and almonds. The finishing touch is coarse sea salt, which enhances the chocolate flavor and adds subtle bite. This cookie goes beyond your typical chocolate chip cookie with its dynamic range of texture, sweetness, and richness.",1.0,8/20/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

We both got matcha lattes (mine iced and hers hot) and we were impressed with how good they are and not overpriced like many spots in the area.

I'm a big fan of all the flowers and setup.  The coffee was great. However I wasn't the biggest fan of the avocado toast. I wanted poached eggs and they said they couldn't do that. After seeing it , it makes sense that it wouldn't go with the other flavors. All in all it was an extra take on a classic.  If you're in the area go; it's adorable. Brunch ends at 4 pm though.",4.0,8/11/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"What a fantastic little treat I found. The nuance and subtlety of this place is exactly what I needed on a Wednesday.  Walk straight to the back to order, (I got the Bridget sandwich, absolutely delicious and unexpected.) If you order coffee, pick it up from the front when you are done ordering. Don't skip on the cookies either  The seating is comfy and airy for New York and the interior is super homey with greenery on the ceiling and a floral print on the wall.  This place is very welcoming.  Along with the food, they also have laptop free tables that promote conversation. A nice touch in this year of 2018.  4.5/5 recommend.  I will definitely be coming back to try some other savory treats!",5.0,8/8/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,Everything was basically sold out at 3:30pm so come early! I ordered the white chocolate pretzel cookie (3.5/5) since their classic chocolate chip cookie was sold out. It was really sweet and indulgent. There wasn't really a pretzel/salty flavor as one would expect besides the pretzel on top of the cookie. I feel like they could do with some pretzel pieces throughout the cookie to really have that sweet and salty contrast flavor. Texture-wise was perfect - soft semi doughy/fudgy cookie with crisp and caramelized edges. Would have been even better if they could warm it up!  The service at the counter was subpar. The baristas who took the orders were not friendly and not helpful at all.,4.0,7/25/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"Maman is absolutely adorable, but I definitely prefer ordering coffee & pastries to-go over sitting down and eating. The coffee is great and comes in the most precious cups, and the pastries are all amazing. Specifically the loaf slices, these are moist and rich, and I love the Matcha one and Berry one. When I came for a sit-down brunch, the food was fine, but nothing special. The waffle hash browns were unfortunately burnt, and the wait time was very long. But I will be back for my take out orders!",2.0,2/13/2019,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"This was such a cute little surprise to find! I was planning on going to another coffee shop around the corner, but after that one was too crowded, I stumbled across Maman. And what a change in ambience! Rather than the chaotic hustle and bustle from the streets outside, Maman provided a quiet, relaxing atmosphere. The best word I think I can use is ""soothing."" The walls are decorated beautifully, the chairs and tables provide a very modern, clean feel, and the lighting is bright and natural. The pastries looked delicious and homemade, and they also had a full food menu. Our barista was also really friendly, making small talk with us and sharing her knowledge about the drinks. I would definitely give Maman 5 stars for atmosphere, ambiance, and customer service.  My only downside was the taste/quality of the beverage I ordered. I ordered an iced matcha latte (for $5.50), and it tasted watery, with only a small amount of matcha. Maybe it's because it was an iced beverage, so it became watered down, but I wouldn't order it again. I'd say 3 stars for taste.  Overall, I think the ambience would make me want to give this place another try!",3.0,6/19/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,-1 point for the waiter being a little rude and not making us feel too welcome. Given it was a busy Sunday lunch time and we ended up just having coffee and pastries but...  Seemed like my friend enjoyed her Americano and got some toasted bread with butter (her go to)! They charged us 3 dollars for the bread and butter just FYI. The coffee cups are super cute especially the to go cups for the hot drinks which is a perfect porcelain dish pattern! I got the matcha latte like drink but there was a little too much milk in it. It was milky and good either way but I think I'll ask them to get a little less milk next time :p  We were lucky and got seated in a few minutes but i think ppl should expect waiting a little especially at peak hours,3.0,5/22/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"I am a big fan of Maman, as I used to frequent their Tribeca location. This one, while still providing good coffee and an aesthetically pleasing space, just isn't my favorite. They have an order station in the front and the back, and they said if we ordered in the back they would send our coffee order to the front. Well, 20 min later, we were standing there with no coffee.  The barista in the front made my drink when I asked where it was, but it was a waste of time. Further, there are a few tables, but they were not being cleaned up. My friend and I had to clear a table for ourselves.",4.0,9/30/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"Maman is a lovely new addition to the Nomad location. It's cozy, spacious and looks like your typical Maman restaurant.  We ordered an ice chai and a regular latte, both of which were good. The white chocolate matcha dipped croissant was a bit too sweet for my liking but super photogenic. The Nutella beignet was a great idea & it would have been better had it been served warm like beignets typically are.  Welcome to Nomad, Maman! I'll see you soon for something savory.",4.0,2/19/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,I unfortunately did not have the best visit yesterday at Maman. My friend and I both ordered the eggs ratatouille. Given it is a dish that is cooked in a cast iron pan it would take a little bit of time to come out of the kitchen. I had ordered a drip coffee that came immediately and I asked for it with some almond milk (2oz if that) on the side which later I found out they charged me $.50 for which was absolutely ridiculous for the amount given. And I didn't even use more than a drop. I don't understand places that do this. If I had asked for cream or regular milk there would be no additional charge. And I completely understand paying extra for non dairy milk in a latte or a drink that has a cup or more of milk but for a drop on the side of my coffee 50 cents is outrageous.  After waiting about 20 min for our food our waitress came over and asked if we were ready for the check... umm no we haven't gotten our food yet. We were both shocked. Did she forget we ordered? Did she not even put our order in? There was no apology for the mistake and instead she flaunted it off that the dish takes time to make. We waited again for awhile then finally received our food. Thankfully it was delicious but the overall experience was not good. I'm bummed about my experience and hope if I decide to come back it will be better.,4.0,9/24/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,I am in love with Maman. This was my first visit and I came with some friends! We arrived at 7am and were seated promptly! I had the Lavender Hot Chocolate! It's a must! Tasted so yummy! The decor is so lovely as well. There is lots of seating even a few seats on the outside as well. Would definitely recommend this place. Its good as well for just relaxing and having a great conversation with friends or family.,5.0,12/18/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"I didn't eat here, but did order an oat milk matcha latte to go. Overall:  + Really nice decor + Pretty takeaway cups + Nice staff  - Very slow to make drinks (the person with me actually left to go do something else because they were taking too long) - Poor matcha latte flavor (first they made it cold by mistake then quickly made a hot one for me...they may have gone too fast when making the second one and missed some ingredients, idk, but it missed the mark)",5.0,8/6/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"Maman is a very cute cafe. I went here for brunch on a Saturday morning. Although it seemed packed, we were able to get a seat without much waiting (there were two of us). I had the tahini cardamom waffles and they were okay, but it wasn't as good as what I had expected. I liked how they were creative with the ingredients of the waffle, but IMO Jackson's Eatery in LIC did a much better job.  The pound cake slices looked very good so I bought it on another day, but that was another disappointment. The presentation is awesome, but I really wish they could vamp up the food quality by a lot.",5.0,4/16/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,Great atmosphere and vibe - nothing too over the top and feels very cozy. About a 30-40 minute wait for a group of 4 on Sunday 12:30pm. Avocado toast is super tasty and their teas/lattes are served in giant cups which is cool. I got the breakfast plate which offered plenty of food.,4.0,2/24/2019,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"Lavender latte WAS SO GOOD. You can definitely taste the lavender and it was not sweet which was great. The food however, was good but not amazing. The almond croissant was very dense. It had s generous amount of almond filling and was not overwhelmingly sweet like how some other croissants can be. But being in New York, there are definitely better options nearby. Hopefully I'll get their specialty croissants next time and it will be something that I come back here for. The other brunch items didn't really stand out to me; they seem just okay. My friends got the hash and lavender waffles and said they were fine. Service was mediocre. I asked for water and was left thirsty with my throat like the Sahara Desert for about 20 minutes until I finally got my water. Very cute place though! I love the decor.",4.0,12/23/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,My new favorite neighborhood coffeehouse of hot chocolate fame in the past. I had tried to go to the soho location on New Years Day for that lavender hot chocolate (closed) but now i suppose i can come here! they have the standard pastries and cafe as well as some bites.  The space used to be a vegan restaurant which most definitely failed in this particular neck of the woods. I have more confidence in this being successful here.  I came back and had an amazing avocado tartine (basically avocado toast) with an egg and the lavender hot chocolate. The drinks are up front but the food is in the back so there is a bit of a disconnect when you sit in. I got a lounge-y area by the back which was nice and cozy. It's very warm in here.  And yes timeout. This lavender hot chocolate is great!,5.0,1/16/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"I was able to stop into the Maman location in Flatiron to grab coffee and catch up with a friend on a Thursday evening. After being to their location in Williamsburg, I only had high hopes for this location in the city. After my experience here I'm happy to report that those hopes were met! From the service to the ambiance, everything made for a great experience!  My friend and I arrived on a Thursday evening around 5:45 PM. When we walked in their were only about 3 other people at the cafe, which surprised me. Maybe this location isn't as packed after work? Maybe people don't know about it as much as their other locations? Regardless, if that's the case, then this is definitely a spot to go to if you're looking to grab coffee with a friend, read a book, or just have some time to yourself.  We both ended up ordering matcha latte's ($5.45). Really great quality and served in a nice mug. Definitely makes for an added plus while you're sitting and enjoying your beverage.  Staff was super nice and extremely considerate. We were their near the time they were closing and they informed us when they were about to clean the space, and when we had a few minutes left before they officially closed.  If anything, I wish Maman had a location in my neighborhood! Until then I'll definitely be making Maman - Nomad my go to spot to grab coffee if I'm ever in the Flatiron area.",1.0,3/12/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

They had gluten free options too - a gluten free granola in their parfait, a gluten free hash brown waffle, and a few salads that can be made gluten free. Only bummer is they didn't have a GF bread option for all their yummy sandwiches. Oh and also had some vegan and vegetarian options. Had an oat milk pumpkin spice latte that kicked Starbucks out of the water! Staff was sweet and attentive. Definitely will be back.",3.0,10/1/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"3.5 stars  I like to wear floral prints, spray floral scents on my wrist, & eat foods/drink beverages with floral elements. I couldn't decide between the Raspberry & Rose Loaf Cake slice and the White Chocolate Lavender Croissant in Maman Nomad's display case. I went for the latter & wished I'd picked the loaf. As it was later in the afternoon, the croissant wasn't super fresh. The white chocolate coating was ultra sweet & overwhelming. To improve its construction, I'd pipe some white chocolate (ganache?) & lavender inside & drizzle the same on the outside.  Despite a so-so first encounter, I'd absolutely give this adorable cafe another shot. Its decorative touches are irresistible (large spoon door handle, white & blue floral accent wall.) I'd love to spend a morning reading a few chapters, indulging in one of their caffeinated drinks, & finally trying that Raspberry & Rose loaf slice.",4.0,7/8/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

I ordered the matcha iced latte and Maman's breakfast sandwich which was delicious! It's a little expensive at $13 for the sandwich considering it didn't come with anything but you won't be disappointed. It's very flavorful, especially with the bacon jam.

Maman Nomad,4.0,"I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning.  I've been to the Maman on Centre St so I was excited to try out this newer location.  There was a line out the door.  There wasn't a hostess so the table service was very slow and disorganized.  I found out later that the girl who was doing take out service was actually supposed to sit guests for table service as well.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2 people.  It took a while for a waitress to come to our table for everything: water, ordering, serving food, and getting the check.  We ordered the lavender banana waffles and the rabbit hole (cornmeal bun stuffed with panchetta, squash, egg, arugula).  By the time we received the entrees, the food was cold.  I did enjoy the rabbit hole brunch entree since it was flavorful and the ingredients were fresh.  I do wish it was warmer.  The waffles were dry since it was made of cornmeal and I didn't taste the lavender.  When I went to the bathroom and walked back to the table, 3 waitresses were blocking the aisle arguing about which tables ordered what.   Clearly, the staff were not well trained so service was a total mess.  I will never come back, will just stick with going to the Centre St location.",4.0,11/4/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"Super cute place. I love the artwork on the espresso machine. Was intrigued by the honey lavender latte -- previously had some similar drinks that I really enjoyed -- was very surprised/pleased, as my initial reaction was ""wow this tastes like grass"" (not in a bad way). I assume this means they use real lavender. Or my taste buds are just WAY off. Either way, I really like it. It can be a bit slow to get your drink, and in the few times I've been there, I've never not been surrounded by selfie-takers.",2.0,2/12/2019,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"Maman said there'd be days like this:  Indeed.  I have long wanted to try this bakeshop cum cafe's famed Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Ever since the raves it received back in its early Soho location days.  And what do I do when I finally make it to Maman, which now boasts zillions of NYC outposts like this one?  What do I do?  I get a Nutella Brownie instead.  I don't know what I was thinking. Or maybe I wasn't thinking at all.  At any rate, I wasn't a fan of said Brownie. It hinted of Nutella, which was a good thing, of course.  But it was just too sweet for me, sadly.  I wanted it to be more fudgy too, but then I am a fudgy brownie sort of girl.  The space though, is beyond adorable.  And service on my visit was every bit as sweet as you'd hope for in a place like this.    Bottom line:  Three stars for now, though when I finally get to try that darn Cookie, maybe that will change.  One way or another.",3.0,10/14/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

Firstly, lots of room to sit. Secondly, all my fave bevs (really into their teas right now) Thirdly, still all the old French charm. Fourthly, mobbed completely in the middle of the day but you can definitely get a table if you head in early. Fifthly, go ahead and have some quiche. I won't tell.

Was also asked to clear the table by four different people throughout the meal even though we were clearly still eating (and waiting for the bread that we asked for multiple times).

Maman Nomad,4.0,"I stepped outside Mile High Run Club after throwing down almost 4 miles, craving caffeine and carbs, and started searching my Yelp app for help. Then I paused, looked up from my phone and realized I was standing right next to this cute little spot. It's not often I don't do my research before going somewhere to grab a bite or drink when I'm traveling, but Maman just looked so warm and inviting I made an exception to the rule.  Cold brew was on point, and I bought a Nutella Beignet and a Pistachio Chocolate Croissant for me and my husband to split. The Nutella beignet was as good as everyone says. The pistachio chocolate croissant... I love pain au chocolat and I love pistachio, but I have also lived in Paris and eaten at Lune Croissanterie in Melbourne, so I have been spoiled/ruined forever for pastry in some regards. I try to keep in mind that lamination of that caliber literally takes days and ain't nobody got time for that. The croissant was certainly above average - I'd probably call it a love child between a paris brest and a croissant in regards to how much pistachio cream was generously stuffed in there. Sorta how new york bagelries will spread cream cheese to excess on your bagel unless instructed otherwise.  Anywho, it was all good enough to be almost erring on the side of five stars except for the barista who seems super annoyed by my to go order of two pastries and a cold brew... because she was busy making a ton of coffee orders for the server who seemed annoyed with her. So I didn't take it personally, but it certainly impacted my experience. But if you're a New Yorker, you probably don't care if the service isn't the best as long as the food is good.

Maman Nomad,4.0,"That was the most delicious avocado toast I've ever had.  Everything was so fresh. My only preference would be for them to mix in the sunflower seeds, chili pepper and salt in the avocado spread instead of being put on the side.  Personally, I dont want to be playing chef and figuring out how much salt and chili flakes i should sprinkle on for optimal taste. Just figure it out for me... it is too early.    Hot chocolate was good,  I liked that it wasn't overly sweet.  But it wasn't the best hot chocolate ever.  I didn't even bother finishing it.  After leaving,  I noticed they overcharged me for my orange juice. It is not by a lot, but they shouldn't be charging customers more than the price indicated on the menu.  The place is so cute!  I would like to come back and try the sandwiches and salads.",3.0,1/28/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"I so love Maman in Tribeca that I was ecstatic to find this Nomad location, one block from where I have a weekly job. My husband and I went on a Saturday afternoon in August, around 2pm. Right away, things were strange. The manager (we assumed) was standing right inside the front doorway having a somewhat heated discussion with one of the kitchen staff. We stood there awkwardly for a few minutes, but neither made a move to stop, or even to slide over so we could get through.  The 2 baristas behind the front counter were just staring at the discussion -- none of the 4 staff members made a move to welcome us, or guide us to the dining seating or ask what we might want at the counter.  We didn't know what to do, and since we had never been there, didn't know where to stand or how to get seated. We awkwardly pushed past the manager and the kitchen staff person and then stood in the dining area. Still, no one said anything to us. A long pause later, the manager finally broke away to ask us if we wanted to sit down. Actually, we didn't -- we wanted to order at the counter but didn't realize that was an option since it was blocked when we entered.  Long story short we ended up ordering 2 coffee drinks and 2 pastries at the counter but the baristas were quite unfriendly and unhelpful. The food and drinks were great, but this has turned me off from ever going to Maman again -- at least not to this location.",3.0,8/29/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"So, the chocolate chip cookies are LEGIT. Definitely in the best-cookie-I've-ever-had running.  The cafe is charming -- in a 'basic white girl spends a semester abroad' sort of way. (Re: the faux vintage everything is a bit much. The 'rustic' wood tables are impossible to wipe down, so there is always half of someone else's breakfast stuck in the cracks.)  And I'm sorry to say that the service is the worst I've ever experienced in any coffeeshop, anywhere. It's not the employees' fault, though; they seem to be always staffed at the wrong place at the wrong time. Or maybe Maman is just understaffed. There is basically ONE person working the register/espresso machine every day during the morning rush. And no one seems capable of managing the flow -- like not making some exotic-milk cappuccino before filling the two drip-coffee orders.  Also, weirdly, they run out of stuff for weeks on end, and don't seem to be able to get more in. Things like, LARGE CUPS. Which we are now on week two without. Oy. Or loyalty stamp cards. (Why not just print something out on the office computer, or overnight less-cutesy-but-still-functional large cups from Amazon?)  A lot of tourists come in and hover awkwardly in a too-small place. A guy keeps his dog at the table sometimes. And the kitchen doesn't open until 8am even though they open at 7am.",4.0,12/4/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"Great place for a fast casual brunch. The wait is usually no longer than 15-20 minutes. They have a variety of food items, ranging from breakfast foods and sandwiches to salads. I highly recommend the waffle-iron hashbrowns - smoked salmon, avocado, greens, soft boiled egg on a hashbrown. The lavender latte is the best I've had in NYC. The pastries taste great as well such as the white chocolate lavender dipped croissant. I like that their pastries have unique flavors compared to other bakeries. And the service has been great every time.",4.0,9/7/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

Maman Nomad,4.0,I used to come here a lot and thought that their matcha latte was on point. Spoke highly about this place. Finally came with people who have never had it before.

Drinks are expensive and very small - my iced matcha tea latte was only okay. Rose berry cake is good -- very dense, moist and right amount of rose. Lavender latte is sweetened the perfect amount and surprisingly delicious! Huge plus that there's WiFi & outlets for laptop use.

Then, when I was finally approached to ask if I would like to place an order the cashier was stunned by my presence. My Gina sandwich came within seconds. It was like I was given someone else's order. The guy literally shoved it at my face. To make matters even worse, the sandwich looked like some tuna was tossed on the ciabatta bread with no lettuce and roasted tomatoes. Which was completely different from the last time I ordered a Gina. It was handed to me without even a bag. While the take-out  in front of me was being served properly.",4.0,9/27/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

I had to ask for my coffee 3 times, seeing all of the tables around got their coffee/, even all of the tables ordered around the same time (back to back). By the third time asking, the waitress gave me some bs excuse:""your coffees are espresso based so they take a while."" Then please, you're telling me the espresso and the two lattes you served the tables around us are not espresso based? Food is great and my lavender mocha is perfect as usual, but I'm probably just going to do take outs from now on instead of brunching at this location.

The coffee is wonderful -- they actually know how to make a cafe mocha that tastes of both coffee and chocolate and isn't sickeningly sweet, just very faintly sweetened.  The pastries are fabulous, especially the nutty chocolate chip cookie (I'm a skilled home baker and it takes a lot to impress me).

Your days will now be filled with flaky, warm, creative pastries and delicious coffee. I had an Americano with oat milk (When did this become such a big thing?! Has science gone too far?) and it was the most delicious thing I had all day.  Beautiful space to sit and write angsty thoughts into your journal. There is a wildly eclectic mix of chairs which makes you sit and think about how they shopped for the furniture. I imagine the owners took a bike tour of all the neighborhoods of New York and got a cool chair at each place, tied it to the back of the tandem, and eventually had so many chairs that they had to open a new Maman to put all these weird chairs in there. Anyway it's adorable and hip.  Best part is the service!

Maman Nomad,4.0,"Stopped by for coffee and a catch up with a friend on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm. The place was pretty packed but we were told it would only be around a 15 minute wait for a table. The interior is super cute - it's bright, light and modern with a rustic feel. We were shown to a table at the very back and ordered our drinks quickly.  The brunch menu looked good - plenty of sandwiches, avocado toast, salads etc to choose from and reasonably priced. That said, we opted just to share a slice of banana bread. My flat white was great, tasted like high quality coffee which makes a real difference. The banana bread with pecans and chocolate chips was very good, plenty big enough to share between two of us. Service was also very good.  Knocking a star off because when we walked in at 2, and waited for the table, we were never advised that they would be closing at 3pm. So we hadn't even finished up when they came around at 2:50 to let us know and ask us to settle the bill. (With tax and tip, it was around $14 which I think is average for the area). I'd come back if meeting friends in the area or closeby and in need of a coffee fix.  Rich and Sophie",3.0,4/12/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

However, it gets crowded a little bit quickly and there is a long wait after 10:30am. I ordered the Maman's Rabbit Hole Sandwich Brunch which I HIGHLY recommend. This stuff was so good and had combinations that I didn't think would go so well. Comes with a cute salad and the chestnut cream in the bread was HEAVENLY.

It's not that they don't taste good, but like overdone American versions of what a real French bakery would have.  Everything is just kind of...extra.  Sandwiches and salads are fine, nothing memorable, nothing you'd crave. But just fine if you are in the neighborhood.  Drinks are a bit on the over-priced side.  The smell in the place is sort of like stale grease. I can't figure out what it is but it's pretty strong and sticks to your clothes and hair.

Maman Nomad,4.0,"Was very excited to have a place in Flatiron area for both good coffee and lunch, and to support a local business. Wandered in and noticed the coffee counter in front and food in the back.  Stood at lunch counter for a while, with the cashier looking off into space until another counter person asked if I wanted help. Ordered the Tawni salad with extra roasted chicken, and asked if I had to go up front for coffee. Blank girl said yes, then the Nice girl said I could order it all together, so got a macchiato and a water. Paid and left a small tip bc maybe blank girl was having a bad day?  Very loud there and disorderly with ppl wandering around but nobody clearing tables and people taking up 2 tops and just drinking water. Def not a place to do work.  I wandered back to blank girl and asked if my food was to go bc I wanted it for here. She says ""I thought you said to go"" I said I didn't say anything bc you didn't ask... she wanders away. I pick up my coffee up front, the pastries look amazing and they have lots of non-milk options. I decide this place is only good for a snack.  Take a call outside, come back in and wander around some more, there are 3 counters and none of them seem places to pick up food. How does it work here?!? I find a guy wandering around and ask him. He says he'll get my salad and make it to stay.  He brings it out, and the egg on top looks like a diner egg, I asked if it has chicken. He says chicken is extra, and I show him my receipt and he examines it for several minutes as if he doesn't believe me. Then says he'll fix it although I've already been waiting 15 mins for overderessed premade salad and torn chicken. I ask for a refund, I watch him take it off the Square, then go get a salad at Num Pang where they call out yoot  Long story short: still have not received the $17- commented on their Square review with no reply. Will only get coffee there and stick to salads at other places in the area.  Upped their stars as I noticed I did get a refund",4.0,3/4/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338

Maman Nomad,4.0,"AMAZING! Love this cute little coffee shop / lunch spot. Food is fresh tasting and fantastic. Brought friends here last weekend for lunch and they couldn't stop talking about how good the food was. If you're in the area, definitely pop in here.",4.0,6/21/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
Maman Nomad,4.0,"JUST FAB! Since my first experience at Maman, I've been back countless times since. My first time I got the grain bowl salad. I believe it's called the ""Tawni"" salad. It's super tasty and filling for a nice healthy lunch. The second time I went- let's just say the Katie Sandwich CHANGED MY LIFE- for the better. The combination of the pesto arugula and grilled chicken is incomparable to anything I've tasted and keep in mind I'd like to think of myself as a sandwich aficionado. Not to mention the cookies are hands down the best cookies I've tried in NYC. I see why Oprah loves them! A MUST GO!",5.0,5/26/2018,40.7432672,-73.9901338
